1,Discord,A Matter of Principals,Really? I thought there must be some mistake.,,
2,Discord,A Matter of Principals,"[through mock tears] I hate goodbyes, don't you? I just go to pieces.",,
3,Discord,A Matter of Principals,"Why, I'm a student of friendship, of course. Unless you don't think you're good enough to teach me.",,
4,Discord,A Matter of Principals,"Fine! From now on, I won't try to help. At! All!",,
5,Discord,A Matter of Principals,"To fill in for Twilight, of course, as head-draconequus. I seem to recall a whole song about how this school is where you make your own rules. Now, who better at that than me?",,
6,Discord,A Matter of Principals,"My problem? How is the fact that Twilight decided to put an incompetent, power-hungry unicorn in charge of her school my problem?!",,
7,Discord,A Matter of Principals,Oh! Some thanks for all my help. And after I hired all those substitute teachers for you.,,
8,Discord,A Matter of Principals,Uh... [stuttering] I don't know what you're getting at.,,
9,Discord,A Matter of Principals,"Oh, I better take this. Hello?",,
10,Discord,A Matter of Principals,"[writing] ""Item one <U+0096> Gravity is optional.""",,
11,Discord,A Matter of Principals,"""Item two <U+0096> The school's new mascot is an ambidextrous marmoset.""",,
12,Discord,A Matter of Principals,"I accept! I mean, I-I-I suppose I can find some time in my busy schedule to help you out. But I will need my own office, expense account, parking space...",,
13,Discord,A Matter of Principals,"Oh, he did not! And what did you say?",,
14,Discord,A Matter of Principals,But then we'd miss out on all those delightful misadventures.,,
15,Discord,A Matter of Principals,"[chuckles] Well, with a few surprises.",,
16,Discord,Celestial Advice,"Or we could go cause a little mischief. I know a trick that'll turn Celestia's castle into cheese. Do you think it's a ""gouda"" idea? [laughs] That's just the first of many cheese jokes if we go down this path.",,
17,Discord,Celestial Advice,"You already planned the perfect moment during the party to make the grand announcement to everypony about your plan. Brava, Twilight! I can't wait to tell your plan to Fluttershy and the others!",,
18,Discord,Celestial Advice,"No, no. Clearly, Starlight is beyond basic friendship lessons. She just won a medal, for Equestria's sake. I thought you were joking. You are joking, right?",,
19,Discord,Celestial Advice,"You weren't coming up with a plan just now, were you? Oh, dear. This could be pretty embarrassing for you.",,
20,Discord,Celestial Advice,Psst! I see what you're doing.,,
21,Discord,Celestial Advice,"Probably because you're not as close as you think you are. [laughs] Just kidding. She wanted it to be a big surprise. Just between us, she's getting ready to make a big announcement!",,
22,Discord,Celestial Advice,Darn it. I was hoping you would send her to my realm. We could've been roomies. Way to not pick up what I was putting down.,,
23,Discord,Celestial Advice,"Oh, Starlight. Princess Twilight has something very important to tell us. Well, just you, really, but I'm nosy and I want to hear.",,
24,Discord,Celestial Advice,"Yes, Starlight is student of the year, isn't she? She has so much potential. So, what are we going to do with her? And by ""we"", I definitely mean ""you"". Being her mentor and all that, her destiny falls squarely on your haunches.",,
25,Discord,Celestial Advice,"Yes, because you did it all by yourself.",,
26,Discord,Celestial Advice,Anytime. I really do love being helpful.,,
27,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"And that's why you're the party expert. Thank you, Pinkie Pie. I feel so much better now.",,
28,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"[sips tea] It did rain the other day, however.",,
29,Discord,Discordant Harmony,How boring. Pass. Hold on! Ginseng tea! Now that sounds promising. What does it sing? I'm partial to something upbeat and jazzy.,,
30,Discord,Discordant Harmony,Do something chaotic? I'll try...,,
31,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Okay, let's give these conversation cards a whirl. [clears throat, reading] ""It is very nice to see you today."" ""Have you read any good books lately?"" ""Your garden looks positively lovely.""",,
32,Discord,Discordant Harmony,This is what you were hoping for? But this is the complete opposite of your tea parties.,,
33,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Make Fluttershy feel comfortable, make Fluttershy feel comfortable, comfortable, comfortable... Well, I mean, that shouldn't be a problem.",,
34,Discord,Discordant Harmony,Oops! [laughs] I forgot that I still had this on!,,
35,Discord,Discordant Harmony,Because you and I don't make sense to anypony else.,,
36,Discord,Discordant Harmony,Of course! I should get her the best of everything. Why didn't I think of that? ...Well? Are you going to answer me or not?,,
37,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Now, let's see. I have the perfect tea and the perfect tea service. What else do I need for the perfect tea party? Oh! Decorations, of course!",,
38,Discord,Discordant Harmony,A teapot that just pours tea? How positively dreadful!,,
39,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Yes, you can. Your finest tea set, please. I want only the best for my friend Fluttershy.",,
40,Discord,Discordant Harmony,What particularly nice weather we're having.,,
41,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"There you go. Back to normal, just the way you like it. See you tomorrow!",,
42,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Oh, dear. That might be a problem.",,
43,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Well, I can just pop us in some more.",,
44,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Why, thank you for noticing. I also couldn't help but notice that you need a refill.",,
45,Discord,Discordant Harmony,Maybe it's not as bad as I think. Maybe Fluttershy would be comfortable having a tea party here.,,
46,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Okay. Since Fluttershy always goes out of her way to host the perfect tea party for me, how do I make my tea party for her even more perfect?",,
47,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Me, too! I'm so excited! I can't wait! No, really, I can't! How about we have the tea party tomorrow afternoon?",,
48,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Well, whatever do you mean? This is just me being me.",,
49,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"[chuckling] Well! In that case, I certainly don't need to be wearing this.",,
50,Discord,Discordant Harmony,Oh! You remembered to cut off the crusts for me.,,
51,Discord,Discordant Harmony,I think you'll be quite pleased with the green tea I've selected for us today.,,
52,Discord,Discordant Harmony,Oh. I never realized how much work you put into hosting these tea parties.,,
53,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Got it! We know Fluttershy, and we know what she likes. First of all, we need to get rid of all the new stuff.",,
54,Discord,Discordant Harmony,Excuse me. Is this where Fluttershy usually buys her tea?,,
55,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Uh, well, it tastes delicious.",,
56,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"No, no, no, no, no! I've been taking advantage of your hospitality for far too long. It's high time I do something about it. What to do, what to do...",,
57,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Yes... judgy... clerk... pony! Why is it such a surprise? Sure, she's on the quieter side, and I'm a bit, well, more showy. But I'll have you know we're besties. And that's why I need the [echoing] best tea set!",,
58,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"I know. I was afraid that if you saw exactly how different we are, you wouldn't want to be friends anymore.",,
59,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Well, that's okay, because I've never hosted a tea party before.",,
60,Discord,Discordant Harmony,And I'm almost certain she likes stairs...,,
61,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Actually, madam, I'm talking to myself.",,
62,Discord,Discordant Harmony,Maybe I just need another set of eyes on this. What do you think?,,
63,Discord,Discordant Harmony,Can I trouble you for another sugarcube?,,
64,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Oh, wonderful! I'll be enjoying her company tomorrow, so I will be needing your very best tea, please. Something especially special.",,
65,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Oh, dear Fluttershy, worry not. I can assure you that for the first time, I'm feeling perfectly normal. Now, let me top you off.",,
66,Discord,Discordant Harmony,It really is nice having you here.,,
67,Discord,Discordant Harmony,Enjoy your all-expense-paid trip around Equestria!,,
68,Discord,Discordant Harmony,Oops! Butterfingers! How embarrassing.,,
69,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,Sit and watch? Fine. We'll play your game. [reverberating] Are you ready to enter the world of Ogres & Oubliettes?,,
70,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"[to himself] Oh, here we go...",,
71,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,I seal Sir McBiggun in a magic bubble until he stops laughing!,,
72,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"Oh, please. Don't stoop to tedious reverse psychology. You're better than that.",,
73,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"Uh... [stammering] No, no, actually, that's not what I meant to say... I'm... sssssss...",,
74,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"Well, I suppose I could squeeze you in if I move a few very important ponies around.",,
75,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"[reverberating] You find yourself on the battlefield. A barrage of arrows rains down on you. If you roll a fifteen or higher, the shield protects you. Fourteen or lower and, well... [laughs] You get the idea.",,
76,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"[snorts] Can I suggest we take a break and, I don't know, go out and have some fun? Ponyville's not going to paint itself red.",,
77,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"Curse myself for attending this infernal evening? Ohhh, no, you mean in the game.",,
78,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,[reverberating] [laughs] Aren't games fun?,,
79,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"I ruined your night, and you don't even think I'm cool? Ugh. [zap] [muffled] How embarrassing. I should go. [normal] I have a lot of other friends I need to see tonight.",,
80,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"Oh, you mean like trapping best friend ponies in hedge mazes and turning them against each other. Those were the days.",,
81,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"[gravelly accent] June, honey, be a dear. Reschedule Luna and Cay-Cay. [normal, aside] That's what I call Princess Celestia, what a hoot! [gravelly accent] In fact, clear the whole evening. Tonight is guys' night. These fellas invited me to spice things up and bring a little class to the whole affair.",,
82,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,I'm not intelligent? I cast it anyway because this game is stupid.,,
83,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,Couldn't I just come with you instead?,,
84,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,This spell here. I transform him into a parsnip.,,
85,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,Games? I love games. I'm great at games.,,
86,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"[gasps] Well, it's not my fault the new train route leads into an active volcano. Guess you'll have to stay.",,
87,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"Don't you laugh at me, Big Mac! Does it really say that? Let me see.",,
88,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"If I'm the worst, then why did you invite me?",,
89,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"I already have the best name in the universe. Why would I change it for something like ""Captain Wuzz""?",,
90,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"That does sound fun, actually...",,
91,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,[scoffs] Consider it considered.,,
92,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,[gasps] So what you're saying is no tea? Ugh. Well. [clears throat] That's fine. I wasn't thirsty anyway.,,
93,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,[clears throat] [mumbling] I'm listening.,,
94,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,This can't be. I'm supposed to feel sorry for you because I'm me and you're you.,,
95,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"Oh, this game is insufferable! Let me show you a real guys' night!",,
96,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"So, shall we hop to it? I made a list of the rowdiest establishments in Ponyville. It's rather short.",,
97,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"Oh, Twilight's friend and Applejack's monosyllabic brother, if only I weren't super busy this evening.",,
98,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"Technically, the fun starts when I arrive, but I'll make sure it's around sunset. Adieu, fellas.",,
99,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"I'm trying to say I'm sorry, all right?! I'm sorry for ruining your game, and I'm sorry that I thought I was better than you! [pants] [quickly] Now let's play before this evening gets any sappier, shall we?",,
100,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,Isn't this what every gamer wants? To live the game? Like this?!,,
101,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"Oh, how kind of you to notice. It's the little details that really bring alternate dimensions to life, wouldn't you say?",,
102,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,Sounds just as miserable as the other options. So fine.,,
103,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"[laughing] This is the life! Jazz, dancing, the best table magic can buy! This is what guys' night is all about. Am I right, fellas?",,
104,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,I stick my head through the bars and demand for the immediate release of the Lord of Chaos.,,
105,Discord,Keep Calm and Flutter On,"Yes, Princess, I'm ready to use my magic for good instead of evil. [under his breath] Most of the time.",,
106,Discord,Keep Calm and Flutter On,"Oh, yes. Thank you, Fluttershy, for your concern. If only your pony friends could be as considerate...",,
107,Discord,Keep Calm and Flutter On,"Oh. Well, it does, very much so. You're so very kind, my dear Fluttershy. I always knew that you were the understanding one, not like those nasty friends of yours.",,
108,Discord,Keep Calm and Flutter On,Oh... [sniggers] He's adorable the way he is.,,
109,Discord,Keep Calm and Flutter On,"Oh, well, I don't know about that. Mistakes happen. Oh, look, everypony, dancing candles!",,
110,Discord,Keep Calm and Flutter On,Now why in the world would I ever try to do a thing like that?,,
111,Discord,Keep Calm and Flutter On,"Oh, our pony guests! [upper class voice] We're so delighted that you've come. Please, do come in.",,
112,Discord,Keep Calm and Flutter On,"Buh-bye, have a nice time! Everything is fine here. Bye bye... Bye bye...",,
113,Discord,Keep Calm and Flutter On,I ask that you never use your Element of Harmony against me. As a sign of our friendship.,,
114,Discord,Keep Calm and Flutter On,Wh-what?! Look at me! I'm practically reformed already.,,
115,Discord,Keep Calm and Flutter On,"Where are you going? What's wrong, pal?",,
116,Discord,Keep Calm and Flutter On,"Oh, yes, very well, I will fix it. I only ask one thing in return.",,
117,Discord,Keep Calm and Flutter On,"Hey there, Fluttershy, you want a turn? The water's great!",,
118,Discord,Keep Calm and Flutter On,"No, I think you just made them mad.",,
119,Discord,Keep Calm and Flutter On,Being turned to stone doesn't keep me from hearing every word Celestia says. Although I admit it makes rolling my eyes a challenge.,,
120,Discord,Keep Calm and Flutter On,"[blows raspberry] You know what else is adorable? You ponies truly believe that you can reform me, and that you're putting your faith in this one here to make it happen. Makes me wanna pinch your little horsey cheeks...",,
121,Discord,Keep Calm and Flutter On,"Oh, you wouldn't dare turn me back to stone and risk disappointing your precious princess.",,
122,Discord,Keep Calm and Flutter On,"[eating] Are you sure this isn't overdoing it? You said to make myself at home while you were gone, but I wouldn't want to overstep my bounds.",,
123,Discord,Keep Calm and Flutter On,"I like it better my way, but... I guess when you're friends, you can't always have things exactly your way all the time, eh?",,
124,Discord,Keep Calm and Flutter On,Whoops! [chuckles] I'm so sorry!,,
125,Discord,Keep Calm and Flutter On,"Oh, yes. Awful business, that. Mm.",,
126,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,"""Oh, Tree Hugger. You're such a great friend. So much funnier than unfunny old Discord!""",,
127,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,"You're supposed to say ""Who's there?""! This is the most basic of jokes!",,
128,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,"Now, listen, Smooze. I need to make this a party of one for a little while. Just stay out here until I come for you.",,
129,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,"I've only got these tiny mismatched wings, and even I can fly better than Twilight Sparkle! Am I right? Pchoo!",,
130,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,"Yes, because that's what you did!",,
131,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,"Ohoho, but that's not all! When I went to look for them again, they were on the ceiling!",,
132,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,"Well, I'm glad you got that, because that's what is true. We are.",,
133,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,"[laughs nervously] Uh, well, perhaps you're into more observational humor.",,
134,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,"Fluttershy, tell the Hugs here about the time that we went to the store and came back with two cakes instead of one, because that's how crazy we are when we're together.",,
135,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,"Oh. Well, you kind of left out all the fun and frivolity there. But I'm sure you got it, Tree Hugger.",,
136,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,"Yes, yes, yes, I believe I got that!",,
137,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,We like each other. That was the point! I'm actually pretty lukewarm about cake.,,
138,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,"Yes, yes, yes, of course. Tell me, have you seen Fluttershy anywhere?",,
139,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,"Uh... [stuttering] No, I suppose not. It would just mean that I'd have different friends for different things... Oh, oh, dear, it looks like I've perhaps overreacted just a skosh.",,
140,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,"Isn't it, though? And to think, it would never have happened had I come to the Gala as somepony else's plus-one.",,
141,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,We should all go out to dinner sometime?! Have you no heart?,,
142,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Do you even know what you just said?,,
143,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,"""No, no, here. Take my plus-one. I insist. Before somepony else thinks he's my friend and expects to be asked instead. What's that? You're worried Discord might be upset?"" Not a problem! I can make more new friends anytime I want. It's not as if any of this actually mattered! I don't even want to go to the Gala anyway!",,
144,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,"Oh, your chakras. [laughs nervously] Fair enough.",,
145,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,"Well, I guess we're just going to have to exclude them from our party this time. Oh, did I say that out loud? I mean, ta-ta.",,
146,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,"Oh, please. I have better things to do than to watch that thing all night. [laughs nervously] What I mean to say is, that thing is a dear, dear friend, and I'll make sure that the ooze, uh, that he can't help but secrete doesn't get on anypony else.",,
147,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,[to the Smooze] You are making me look like a fool in front of Fluttershy. I'll be back when the Gala is over.,,
148,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Are you perhaps looking for me?,,
149,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,"He does have a yen for shiny things, the rascal.",,
150,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,"I owe you an apology, Smooze. I spent the whole evening thinking about my own feelings and never thinking about yours.",,
151,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Relax. I'm not going to hurt you. I'm simply going to send you to another dimension. I can't have you interfering in my relationship with Fluttershy anymore!,,
152,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,"Good evening, everypony! What a glorious affair!",,
153,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,"You? [laughs] Of course not! You think I don't have other friends? I'm centuries old! I was talking about the Smooze! Smooze Face, the Smoozinator <U+0096> well, I mean that's what we called him back in college. Smooze! I would like you to meet Fluttershy and, um, hmm... Tree... how'd you say it... Tree Embrace?",,
154,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,[grimly] Why is this so late?,,
155,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,You know what? Cancel my order.,,
156,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,"I'm doing her a favor, Fluttershy! It's a lovely dimension! White sand beaches, attentive wait staff... I mean, okay, the humidity isn't great, but where isn't that the case these days?",,
157,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,"Oh, oh! It looks like somepony wants to mingle. We'll be back in a bit.",,
158,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,"As well as we could, considering you've already stomped all over our friendship by inviting her to the biggest night of the year as if I didn't matter at all!",,
159,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,"I don't suppose that, uh, these adorable little cutie pies have their own tickets to the Gross Gruesome Gala, do they?",,
160,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,"Actually, Pinkie Pie, who are you taking to... I mean, do you... eugh, oh, you know what? I am famished. I'll take all the cakes.",,
161,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,I guess every being in Equestria is funny today.,,
162,Discord,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Why don't you ask your zebra friend if she knows anything?,,
163,Discord,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,"Well then, it seems we've reached an impasse. I'm telling the truth, but you think I'm lying. What do friends like us do in a situation like this, Princess Twilight? Congrats, by the way, on the promotion. You totally deserve it.",,
164,Discord,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,"Why, [chuckles] whatever are you talking about?",,
165,Discord,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,"I suppose I could, but after all the hoof pointing and besmirching of my good name, I just don't know if I'm up to it.",,
166,Discord,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,"Don't get me wrong. I absolutely love what you've done with the place, but I couldn't possibly take responsibility. I'm reformed, don't you remember?",,
167,Discord,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,"[singing] Winter Wrap Up, Winter Wrap-ooh! [laughs] Now, Twilight, you know Princess Celestia said that you were to give me a heads up before you summon me with that little spell she gave you. In case you haven't noticed, I was in the middle of a particularly invigorating shower.",,
168,Discord,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,"I for one found it delightful. Sort of a one-pony theater piece, if you will. You should really consider taking it on the road.",,
169,Discord,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,And rob you of a valuable lesson about being princess? What kind of friend do you think I am?,,
170,Discord,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,"Oh, I do hope she breaks into a song this time!",,
171,Discord,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,I'm just surprised that you agreed to their plan. I never thought you'd be the kind of pony who would think she was better than everypony else.,,
172,Discord,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,[laughing] You should see yourselves right now. The expressions on your face. So intense. So sure of yourselves. [laughing] Hilarious!,,
173,Discord,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,"Oh, I doubt that. [munching] Hungry? [voice over] Well, obviously things didn't go according to my original plan. My plunderseeds should have stolen the magic from the Tree of Harmony and captured Princess Celestia and Princess Luna thousands of moons ago. Alas, it seems the tree had enough magic to keep the seeds from growing up big and strong. Until now, that is.",,
174,Discord,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,I'm reformed. Don't you remember? Why don't you ask your zebra friend?,,
175,Discord,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,"Oh, I doubt that. [munching] Hungry? Suit yourselves. Oh! What have you got there?",,
176,Discord,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,I have no idea. Those seeds I planted should have sprouted up ages ago.,,
177,Discord,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,"Bravo, ladies, bravo! How ever did you save the day this time? Blast the beastie with your magic necklaces, I presume? Where are those little trinkets of yours? You know, the ones you use to send me back to my extremely uncomfortable stone prison?",,
178,Discord,The Break Up Break Down,"Of course. ""Love is... something-something, and Discord is great."" I don't know. Can we play O&O now?",,
179,Discord,The Break Up Break Down,"Well, not yet, technically. In fact, she can't break your heart if you break hers first.",,
180,Discord,The Break Up Break Down,"Calico's Ring of Imperceptibility isn't going to reclaim itself, you know.",,
181,Discord,The Break Up Break Down,"But I do like tea! Every tea! All the teas! Chamomile, Earl Grey, green, white, yellow, mate, lemon, ginger, chai, spearmint, peppermint, hibiscus... [inhale] ...cinnamon, pumpkin spice.",,
182,Discord,The Break Up Break Down,Ta-da! Happy Hearts and Hooves Day!,,
183,Discord,The Break Up Break Down,"Oh, I hate seeing you like this, Big Mac. And over a girl, no less. I'm calling an emergency Guys' Night [poof!] right now to cheer you up.",,
184,Discord,The Break Up Break Down,"Huzzah, fellow adventurers! Shall we storm the ramparts of Squizard's castle to reclaim Calico's Ring of Imperceptibility?",,
185,Discord,The Break Up Break Down,"[whispering] Yes, what did she do to deserve this?",,
186,Discord,The Break Up Break Down,Keep your eye on the pie. [<e0> la Doug Henning] It's magic time!,,
187,Discord,The Break Up Break Down,"No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no. No, he's not. Let me see that.",,
188,Discord,The Break Up Break Down,[sniffing] This smells... uh... palatable.,,
189,Discord,The Break Up Break Down,"I'm a realist. And love, like all things warm and fuzzy, isn't real.",,
190,Discord,The Break Up Break Down,"""Spike <U+0096> Love is about spying in the bushes.""",,
191,Discord,The Break Up Break Down,How can they be happy if they aren't playing Ogres & Oubliettes?,,
192,Discord,The Break Up Break Down,"Well, she certainly doesn't seem to have appreciated it.",,
193,Discord,The Break Up Break Down,"You did summon me for a rousing Guys' Night of Ogres & Oubliettes, did you not?",,
194,Discord,The Break Up Break Down,You seem to be mixing up [poof!] the Lord of Chaos [poof!] with a second-rate clown magician for hire.,,
195,Discord,The Break Up Break Down,Oh. I should probably have said something.,,
196,Discord,The Break Up Break Down,Please. Can't you see that that holiday is a commercialized ruse pushed on you by the greeting card industry?,,
197,Discord,The Break Up Break Down,Lesson one <U+0096> nothing can break your heart if you only love yourself. You've got to show everypony that you're too cool to be bothered with so-called love. Observe.,,
198,Discord,The Break Up Break Down,"This is how cool guys lean against things. When you see a guy leaning against a thing looking this cool, you think, ""Wow! That guy doesn't have a care in Equestria. Not a guy who leans on things that cool.""",,
199,Discord,The Return of Harmony Part 1,"[laughter] Make sense? Oh, what fun is there in making sense?",,
200,Discord,The Return of Harmony Part 1,"[chuckling] Did you miss me, Celestia? I missed you. It's quite lonely being encased in stone, but you wouldn't know that, would you, because I don't turn ponies into stone.",,
201,Discord,The Return of Harmony Part 1,"Listen closely, this is important. A weighty choice is yours to make:<U+00A0>the right selection or a big mistake. If a wrong choice you choose to pursue, the foundations of home will crumble without you.",,
202,Discord,The Return of Harmony Part 1,"Hey, I'm here to deliver a message.",,
203,Discord,The Return of Harmony Part 1,"Oh, for goodness sake! You've been kind for far too long, my dear. Time to be cruel. Arrivederci!",,
204,Discord,The Return of Harmony Part 1,It's hardly different. Your friends laugh at you all the time.,,
205,Discord,The Return of Harmony Part 1,"Oh, poor Pinkie Pie. And here I thought laughter made you happy.",,
206,Discord,The Return of Harmony Part 1,"Oh, I'd forgotten how grim you can be, Celestia. It's really quite boring.",,
207,Discord,The Return of Harmony Part 1,"That box contains your wings. You can take them and leave the game, or you can carry on aimlessly wandering this maze. Your choice.",,
208,Discord,The Return of Harmony Part 1,"The beautiful Rarity, representing the element of generosity, if I'm not mistaken?",,
209,Discord,The Return of Harmony Part 1,"Oh, I know much more than that, honest Applejack.",,
210,Discord,The Return of Harmony Part 2,"[laughter] Everypony has to play, or the game is over and I win.",,
211,Discord,The Return of Harmony Part 2,I never said they were in the labyrinth.,,
212,Discord,The Return of Harmony Part 2,"I certainly am. You've clearly out-dueled me, and now it's time to meet my fate. I'm prepared to be defeated now, ladies. Fire when ready.",,
213,Discord,The Return of Harmony Part 2,"[laughter] Chaos is a wonderful, wonderful thing.",,
214,Discord,The Return of Harmony Part 2,Picture it. The chaos capital of the world.,,
215,Discord,The Return of Harmony Part 2,"It's priceless! [laughing] Come now, Twilight Sparkle. You've got to get into the spirit of things! After all, this is your new home.",,
216,Discord,The Return of Harmony Part 2,[laughter] It's just too entertaining.,,
217,Discord,The Return of Harmony Part 2,"Well, wait a few minutes and you'll see it in the beautiful light of day. Or not.",,
218,Discord,The Return of Harmony Part 2,"Oh, you ponies are just the most fun I've had in aeons.",,
219,Discord,The Return of Harmony Part 2,Huh. What's this? No. NO!!!,,
220,Discord,The Return of Harmony Part 2,"Ugh, gag. Fine, go ahead. Try and use your little Elements. Friend me. Just make it quick. I'm missing some excellent chaos here.",,
221,Discord,Three's A Crowd,"Well, [clears throat] you'll want to head north, turn left, th<U+0097> Oh... You know, it'd be much easier if I took you there myself.",,
222,Discord,Three's A Crowd,"Well, of course I'm sick. The blue skin? These sneezes? Could somebody find me a fainting couch?",,
223,Discord,Three's A Crowd,"What? I was simply going to ask for a teeny, tiny glass of water.",,
224,Discord,Three's A Crowd,I'll be grateful for your charity Until the bitter end Because I've heard that tenderness Is what you lend an ailing friend,,
225,Discord,Three's A Crowd,"[sneezes] [blows nose] Because this condition has left me helpless, simply helpless! Why, I can barely lift a spoon.",,
226,Discord,Three's A Crowd,"Well, I couldn't travel that far in my condition. By the time I got there, I'd be too weak to even attempt to retrieve the flower.",,
227,Discord,Three's A Crowd,"[sniffing] No, not a ""what"", but a ""who"", dear.",,
228,Discord,Three's A Crowd,"Oh, dear, dear Princesses, I'm sorry to say that I'm sick. [hacks] Blue flu.",,
229,Discord,Three's A Crowd,But how was I supposed to know for sure that I'm truly still friends with one of the most important ponies around?,,
230,Discord,Three's A Crowd,"Well, I was in my thinking tree <U+0096> that's where I do most of my really deep thinking <U+0096> I was there, and I said to myself, I said, ""Discord, your friend Twilight says that she's your pal, but she never writes and she never pops in for a visit.""",,
231,Discord,Three's A Crowd,Did I hear you two talking about Princess Cadance's visit with Princess Twilight?,,
232,Discord,Three's A Crowd,Disturb them? I wouldn't dream of it. Not when I have two such dear friends of my own who have already offered to take care of me. And at such peril! This flu of mine is highly- [snorts] [sneezes] contagious.,,
233,Discord,Three's A Crowd,"Oh, how elated I am to hear that. Shall the three of us head back to your place? I don't want to get anypony else sick.",,
234,Discord,Three's A Crowd,"I so hope you don't mind, Pinkie Pie.",,
235,Discord,Three's A Crowd,"Just knowing that I have a good friend like you to take care of me has made me feel better already. I'll be fine here on my own. Oh, just before you go, just a little small request.",,
236,Discord,Three's A Crowd,"But taking in the sick and the desperate - isn't that what Fluttershy would do? Isn't 'helping' something that friends do for friends? Unless, of course, you're really saying that you're not my friend.",,
237,Discord,Three's A Crowd,"Slipped my mind. On a hill at the very edge of Equestria, there grows an exquisite magic flower. Pick the flower as it drops its petals at sunset. Then you can make a magical soothing elixir to cure the blue flu.",,
238,Discord,Three's A Crowd,"Well, then lucky for you. We're here.",,
239,Discord,Three's A Crowd,"Well, of course we do! We're friends! It's just such a shame that today of all days is when I really need her. Oh, well, I know what to do.",,
240,Discord,Three's A Crowd,And while I get a little rest A teeny tiny small request Some codfish oil for my chest Poured from a crystal cruet,,
241,Discord,Three's A Crowd,"Oh, of course, her trip to see the Breezies. Ah, yes, I had forgotten that was today.",,
242,Discord,Three's A Crowd,"Well, she told me about it in her last letter.",,
243,Discord,Three's A Crowd,"By seeing if you would go to the ends of Equestria for me, of course. Which you did, literally. Congratulations, Twilight, you passed my friendship test!",,
244,Discord,Three's A Crowd,"And if they're not, this rare opportunity to focus on their friendship will certainly bring them closer. Unless...",,
245,Discord,Three's A Crowd,"I'm so glad that you're back from your trip, Fluttershy. Just your presence here is making me feel so much better. I was just wondering, could I trouble you for just one more thing?",,
246,Discord,To Where and Back Again - Part 1,"You know whenever ponies talk about powerful magic, they always leave me out. If I weren't so evolved, I might decide to take it personally. Well, isn't this quite the combination of secondary characters? Where are Twilight and the girls?",,
247,Discord,To Where and Back Again - Part 1,[hushed] They took Fluttershy?,,
248,Discord,To Where and Back Again - Part 2,So I'm able to rip the very fabric of reality again.,,
249,Discord,To Where and Back Again - Part 2,"Not exactly great and powerful, but effective.",,
250,Discord,To Where and Back Again - Part 2,I don't suppose you brought any throne-destroying tools along with these useless sideshow props.,,
251,Discord,To Where and Back Again - Part 2,It is certainly a pleasure to have such dedicated fans. I'll have to come back with some new material after I rescue Fluttershy.,,
252,Discord,To Where and Back Again - Part 2,"Oh, I don't know how any of you manage not being able to disappear and reappear whenever you want!",,
253,Discord,To Where and Back Again - Part 2,"Well, it's decent chaos. I don't know if I'd call it ""total"".",,
254,Discord,To Where and Back Again - Part 2,"Well, if you think that you can do any better, be my guest!",,
255,Discord,To Where and Back Again - Part 2,[hushed] They took Fluttershy?,,
256,Discord,To Where and Back Again - Part 2,"Oh, well. If at first you don't succeed...",,
257,Discord,To Where and Back Again - Part 2,"Yes, but when the throne is destroyed, I'll be able to rip the very fabric of reality to save our friends, while you'll still be a self-absorbed, below-average illusionist!",,
258,Discord,To Where and Back Again - Part 2,"[laughs] Oh, that's adorable. But you see, unlike you, I can do anything.",,
259,Discord,To Where and Back Again - Part 2,This seems like one of those moments where we need a plan.,,
260,Discord,To Where and Back Again - Part 2,"[sarcastic] Well, that's reassuring.",,
261,Discord,To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Ugh. I really think we need a new code word!,,
262,Discord,To Where and Back Again - Part 2,"Oh, this is so strange. We're here and that's there, and I clearly meant for us to be there and not here.",,
263,Discord,To Where and Back Again - Part 2,"That's all very nice, but really a waste of time. We have me. And what else could we possibly need?",,
264,Discord,To Where and Back Again - Part 2,"Why are you here again? I mean, it's not like you're going to stop the changelings by pulling a rabbit out of a hat. At least my magic can do something.",,
265,Discord,To Where and Back Again - Part 2,But you are obviously not Fluttershy!,,
266,Discord,To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Splendid idea! Now who's ready for some celebratory tea at Fluttershy's?!,,
267,Discord,Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,I have done nothing of the sort!,,
268,Discord,Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,"Oh, just a bit of light reading before I head off on my extremely important mission. I suppose you all know that I've been tasked to capture a certain escapee.",,
269,Discord,Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,"[mock sadness] Oh, my. Is eavesdropping not the way you're supposed to find out what your best pals are up to? Woe is me. Will I ever learn the intricate nuances of being a good friend?",,
270,Discord,Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,"[laughs] Oh, you're talking about me, I presume?",,
271,Discord,Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,"Oopsie-doopsie, I almost left with the little journal you've all been keeping. What a fascinating read. Haven't you girls just learned so much? I've bookmarked a few of the more interesting passages. You really should take a look! [to Fluttershy, hushed] We're still on for tea later, aren't we, Fluttershy?",,
272,Discord,Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,"You're right, Spike. It is a big deal. Seems I possess a magic that gives me quite an important role in Equestria. Maybe they should make me an Alicorn princess.",,
273,Discord,Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,"[singsong] Well, I'll bring the cucumber sandwiches...!",,
274,Discord,Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,I did. I imagine they'll be your last decent meal for quite some time.,,
275,Discord,Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,[shivers] That can't be right.,,
276,Discord,Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,[weakly] But you said this was a sign of your gratitude and loyalty. A gift from someone close to you.,,
277,Discord,Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,"Wait a minute, where's my throne?!",,
278,Discord,Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,"Shining Armor, why, whatever are you doing here?",,
279,Discord,Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,"Thank you, Twilight. [to Fluttershy, hushed] I'm sorry.",,
280,Discord,Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,"Oh, my! I do love a good accessory. I suppose that's Rarity's influence.",,
281,Discord,Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,"Oh, we were. But Tirek offered me so much more than just tea parties. Surely you saw this coming.",,
282,Discord,Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,"Tirek tricked me into believing that he could offer me something more valuable than friendship. But there is nothing worth more. I see that now. He lied when he said that this medallion was given as a sign of gratitude and loyalty. But when I say that it is a sign of our true friendship, I am telling the truth.",,
283,Discord,Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,"[muffled] Oh, but you are, Fluttershy. You're the pony that taught me that friendship is magic. I had magic and friendship, and now I don't have either.",,
284,Discord,Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,"[laughs] Oh, you're talking about me, I presume?",,
285,Discord,Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Or perhaps these things just take time.,,
286,Discord,Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Haven't you girls just learned so much?,,
287,Discord,What About Discord?,"[imitating Bob Ross] You see, we were all at Sweet Apple Acres, and I ended up turning the trees into the most<U+0097> [normal] Oh, who am I kidding? I simply can't do it justice. You really had to be there.",,
288,Discord,What About Discord?,"Hi, Twilight! The gang mentioned we'd all be hanging out together today!",,
289,Discord,What About Discord?,"Certainly we can all agree that Princess Twilight learned a valuable lesson here <U+0096> that even she can have feelings of jealousy, that she should recognize said feelings rather than trying to pretend that she doesn't have them. Mm-hmm. Did I get the tiniest bit of glee out of watching her try to recreate our weekend of fun in the name of science? Oh, most definitely! But what's important here is that it was never my intent to make Twilight feel jealous. That's something that the old me would have tried to do. Orange you glad I've changed?",,
290,Discord,What About Discord?,You do seem to be turning a shade of... [gasps] orange!,,
291,Discord,What About Discord?,"Orange! Like the ones at the Applejack farm! I-I mean, from this weekend!",,
292,Discord,What About Discord?,Twilight! This makes twice I'm seeing you in one day! Aren't I lucky?,,
293,Discord,What About Discord?,"[laughing] Catch you later, Twilight.",,
294,Discord,What About Discord?,Of course none of this would've happened if I hadn't encouraged everypony not to invite you this weekend.,,
295,Discord,What About Discord?,We literally trotted for our lives. Isn't that hilarious?,,
296,Discord,What About Discord?,One change to the equation could ruin the experiment. Twilight said so herself. Anything stand out as being different? Anything at all?,,
297,Discord,What About Discord?,Of course not. That whole jealousy thing was just a happy accident.,,
298,Discord,What About Discord?,[laughing] Just snaking around!,,
299,Discord,What About Discord?,"Oh, what a brilliant idea! Shall we begin with the lunch date that kicked off the glorious weekend you missed out on?",,
300,Discord,What About Discord?,"You weren't there observing us. No matter how hard we try, we can't possibly recreate our weekend of fun exactly as it happened because you'll always be watching, and you weren't there.",,
301,Discord,What About Discord?,"Well, I don't know about the rest of you, but I feel we've been pretty exhaustive in our attempts to recreate every single detail of our previous encounter.",,
302,Discord,What About Discord?,"Oh, but we must! It's for the greater good! It started when we were helping Granny Smith with her garden...",,
303,Discord,What About Discord?,I'm just sorry that all this bonding happened while you were holed up in your castle.,,
304,Discord,What About Discord?,"A little to the left! No, my left! A little bit more... Oh, no, no, no, no, no, a little more right!",,
305,Discord,What About Discord?,The tablecloth. It isn't the same color as the one the restaurant used on the day in question.,,
306,Discord,What About Discord?,I-I-I don't get it. Somepony want to tell me what's so hilarious? Anypony? Hello?!,,
307,Discord,What About Discord?,"Well, let me try and paint her a picture, dearest.",,
308,Discord,What About Discord?,Ohhhhhh... it was this table here.,,
