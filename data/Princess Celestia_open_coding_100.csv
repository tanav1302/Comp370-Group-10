1,Princess Celestia,A Bird in the Hoof,What is going on here? Twilight?,,
2,Princess Celestia,A Bird in the Hoof,Nothing means more to me than the well-being of all my subjects.,,
3,Princess Celestia,A Bird in the Hoof,"And I do appreciate that your heart was in the right place, child. But all you had to do was ask me and I could have told you Philomena was a phoenix and saved you all this trouble.",,
4,Princess Celestia,A Bird in the Hoof,"Of course not, my little pony. Where on Earth would you get such an idea?",,
5,Princess Celestia,A Bird in the Hoof,"This is Philomena. She's quite a sight, as I said. But nothing unusual for a phoenix. Isn't that right, Philomena?",,
6,Princess Celestia,A Bird in the Hoof,"Really? Well, if I must... I'm sorry, everypony. I'm afraid I have to cut the party short. The mayor has requested an audience with me. Royal duty calls. Thank you for a wonderful time. It's been a joy getting to know you all better.",,
7,Princess Celestia,A Bird in the Hoof,[sips] [sips] [sips] Gotcha!,,
8,Princess Celestia,A Bird in the Hoof,"And what about you, dear? Fluttershy, is it?",,
9,Princess Celestia,A Bird in the Hoof,"Everything is fine, Mr. and Mrs. Cake.",,
10,Princess Celestia,A Bird in the Hoof,"As do I. As Princess, I care deeply about all creatures, great and small.",,
11,Princess Celestia,A Bird in the Hoof,"She is quite a sight, isn't she?",,
12,Princess Celestia,A Bird in the Hoof,"Oh, stop fooling around, Philomena. You're scaring everypony.",,
13,Princess Celestia,A Bird in the Hoof,"A phoenix is a majestic and magical bird. While it appears healthy and happy most of the time, every so often it must renew itself by shedding all of its feathers and bursting into flame. [silently] Rather melodramatic, if you ask me. [loud again] It then rises from the ashes, fresh as a daisy. All just a normal part of the life cycle of a phoenix. I'm afraid mischievous little Philomena here took the occasion to have a little fun with you, Fluttershy. Say you're sorry, young lady.",,
14,Princess Celestia,A Bird in the Hoof,I understand from Twilight Sparkle's letters that you enjoy tending to the needs of woodland creatures.,,
15,Princess Celestia,A Bird in the Hoof,"Ah, Philomena, my pet. You're awake. Do say hello to our gracious hosts.",,
16,Princess Celestia,A Bird in the Hoof,"No, that's quite all right. I think I can remember.",,
17,Princess Celestia,A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,"I'll say a few words, and then we'll begin with the vows. Shining Armor, you'll get the ring from your best mare.",,
18,Princess Celestia,A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,"Perfect, girls. No need to rush. Then of course, Cadance will enter.",,
19,Princess Celestia,A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,You have a lot to think about.,,
20,Princess Celestia,A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,"Hm. The union of Princess Cadance and Shining Armor. The strength of their commitment is clear. The power of their love, undeniable. May we have the rings please? I now pronounce you mare and colt!",,
21,Princess Celestia,A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,The Elements of Harmony. You must get to them and use their power to defeat the queen.,,
22,Princess Celestia,A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Don't worry about me. I'm fine. You have a real wedding to put together.,,
23,Princess Celestia,A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,"No. You won't. You may have made it impossible for Shining Armor to perform his spell, but now that you have so foolishly revealed your true self, I can protect my subjects from you!",,
24,Princess Celestia,A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,"Rainbow Dash, that's your cue.",,
25,Princess Celestia,A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,"Mares and gentlecolts, we are gathered here today to witness the union of [muffled] Princess Mi Amore Cadenza and Shining Armor.",,
26,Princess Celestia,A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,"Mares and gentlecolts, we are gathered here today to celebrate the union of the real Princess Mi Amore Cadenza<U+0096>",,
27,Princess Celestia,A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,"Princess Cadance and Shining Armor, it is my great pleasure to pronounce you<U+0096>",,
28,Princess Celestia,A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,"This is your victory as much as theirs. You persisted in the face of doubt, and your actions led to your being able to bring the real Princess Cadance back to us. Learning to trust your instincts is a valuable lesson to learn.",,
29,Princess Celestia,A Royal Problem,[sighs] Perhaps. But she is like this every morning.,,
30,Princess Celestia,A Royal Problem,"You think I don't get tired? I'm exhausted! Oh, I apologize for not noticing flowers in a wall sconce. But by the time I get to retire for the night, I can barely see straight! Even so, I still make an effort to smile!",,
31,Princess Celestia,A Royal Problem,"And you have it so much worse, do you?! You've spent your evenings flitting around giving ponies lovely dreams! Oh, it sounds just awful!",,
32,Princess Celestia,A Royal Problem,"Don't worry, Starlight. I know how to handle Nightmare Moon.",,
33,Princess Celestia,A Royal Problem,"[sighs] But it means a lot that you tried. I love you, sister.",,
34,Princess Celestia,A Royal Problem,"Of course, Starlight! I really enjoy doing it. It's a small way to say I care.",,
35,Princess Celestia,A Royal Problem,"Well, there's nothing wrong here. Right, sister?",,
36,Princess Celestia,A Royal Problem,"Oh, Luna, I can't do this! I was wrong! Your job is so incredibly hard! You have to battle nightmares and work in the darkness and do it all alone! It takes such a brave, strong pony to do what you do!",,
37,Princess Celestia,A Royal Problem,[gasps] What have you done?!,,
38,Princess Celestia,A Royal Problem,"Oh, hello, Starlight. I don't know about you, but I feel very well-rested. Where's Luna?",,
39,Princess Celestia,A Royal Problem,"[laughs] Oh, you really are a card!",,
40,Princess Celestia,A Royal Problem,"That's not true! Even when we were apart, I knew I needed her!",,
41,Princess Celestia,A Royal Problem,"You can try. I haven't had an easy day in, well, ever! But now, I get to sleep, and tonight will be a breeze. All right, Starlight Glimmer. We will do this.",,
42,Princess Celestia,A Royal Problem,"Now, to save some ponies from their nightmares. Which aren't real, so it shouldn't be too hard, right? Right. Good call, Celestia! And I'm talking to myself again.",,
43,Princess Celestia,A Royal Problem,"All right. Everypony's asleep. You're talking to yourself, Celestia. Heh. But there's nopony else to talk to! [chuckles] Yet. I can talk to ponies in their dreams!",,
44,Princess Celestia,A Royal Problem,So the map sent you to solve a friendship problem?,,
45,Princess Celestia,A Royal Problem,Only because you were here. I don't know how you do this alone.,,
46,Princess Celestia,A Royal Problem,It was just what we needed. The experience has made us closer than ever.,,
47,Princess Celestia,A Royal Problem,"In that case, they are terrible!",,
48,Princess Celestia,A Royal Problem,Did she now? It seems my duties were harder than my sister expected.,,
49,Princess Celestia,A Royal Problem,"And yet you know exactly what it's like to be me?! Oh, please!",,
50,Princess Celestia,A Royal Problem,"Really? Oh, that is wonderful, Starlight! What is it?",,
51,Princess Celestia,A Royal Problem,I believe that one means your mission is complete.,,
52,Princess Celestia,A Royal Problem,Moon raised! It's even easier than raising the sun. [chuckles] What's next?,,
53,Princess Celestia,A Royal Problem,No! I'll never turn into you!,,
54,Princess Celestia,A Royal Problem,"No, you're not! You are not real, and you will never exist again!",,
55,Princess Celestia,A Royal Problem,Starlight! I'm here now. Tell me what's wrong.,,
56,Princess Celestia,A Royal Problem,It's Starlight Glimmer's. She's afraid this is what will happen if we continue to fight!,,
57,Princess Celestia,A Royal Problem,"Good morning, sister! Join us?",,
58,Princess Celestia,A Royal Problem,[laughing] It's all real. It was the right call going with your gut.,,
59,Princess Celestia,A Royal Problem,But my magic isn't powerful enough! I thought if we worked together...!,,
60,Princess Celestia,A Royal Problem,"Like I said, I enjoy this part.",,
61,Princess Celestia,A Royal Problem,"Oh! Heh. H-How... eh, nice. Ahem. [chews, gags, gulps] They're... delicious. Heh. Thank you.",,
62,Princess Celestia,Call of the Cutie,...can actually be the thing that helps you make your closest friends and realize how special you are. Hmm...,,
63,Princess Celestia,Castle Mane-ia,"[voice over] As you know, the ancient castle that I once shared with Princess Luna lies mostly in ruins, deep in the Everfree Forest. But if you look carefully, you may find a book that could prove helpful to your research, hidden somewhere in what's left of the castle library.",,
64,Princess Celestia,Celestial Advice,"[voiceover] Uh, yes, Spike. I had a decision to make. Oh, but it wasn't easy.",,
65,Princess Celestia,Celestial Advice,I think Starlight Glimmer might feel the same way about you. If that is what you're afraid of.,,
66,Princess Celestia,Celestial Advice,"Only you can make that decision. It's a difficult one, but your heart knows what's right, even as it hurts.",,
67,Princess Celestia,Celestial Advice,So you have an overachieving student. Sounds familiar.,,
68,Princess Celestia,Celestial Advice,"[voiceover] Yes, Spike. I was constantly surprised and impressed with her discoveries. But I noticed that her pursuit of academia was preventing her from reaching her full potential.",,
69,Princess Celestia,Celestial Advice,"Here we are after all these years, Twilight. We are living proof that letting someone spread their wings doesn't mean you no longer have a place in their lives.",,
70,Princess Celestia,Celestial Advice,"Uh, this is Twilight's fantasy, Spike. There is no wrong way to fantasize.",,
71,Princess Celestia,Celestial Advice,"What if she runs into a manticore? Or what if she gets pulled into Tartarus? Or, worst of all, what if she doesn't get along with anypony?!",,
72,Princess Celestia,Celestial Advice,"It's a wonderful feeling, isn't it? Watching your student shine the way you always knew they could.",,
73,Princess Celestia,Celestial Advice,"Oh, Twilight, I'm not. I'm laughing because I had the exact same fears you're having.",,
74,Princess Celestia,Celestial Advice,"Maybe I could close the library or throw a party in the castle. Oh, she'd have to talk to the other fillies then! Oh. I must send her away.",,
75,Princess Celestia,Celestial Advice,And that's why we're proud and honored to give them the Equestrian Pink Hearts of Courage!,,
76,Princess Celestia,Celestial Advice,"This seems like a lovely path for Starlight. The changelings have so much to learn about how to enjoy love through friendships. Starlight would be busy for a very long time, but her work there would be very rewarding.",,
77,Princess Celestia,Celestial Advice,"I loved having you as a student. You challenged me and taught me just as much as I taught you. I am embarrassed to admit it, but I was afraid if you made friends, you wouldn't need me anymore.",,
78,Princess Celestia,Celestial Advice,I can only imagine what that feels like.,,
79,Princess Celestia,Celestial Advice,"Let me tell you a story. Once upon a time, there was a very bright young filly.",,
80,Princess Celestia,Celestial Advice,"And if you're still worried, you can always make her write you letters.",,
81,Princess Celestia,Celestial Advice,"Hmm. I was not aware that I was an expression. An appropriate one, of course, for even I don't know the answer. This is a momentous decision. You must consider all the possibilities.",,
82,Princess Celestia,Celestial Advice,[voiceover] She was truly one of my best students.,,
83,Princess Celestia,Celestial Advice,"[voiceover] I knew there was a special group of fillies in Ponyville, but I kept inventing all kinds of reasons why I shouldn't send you.",,
84,Princess Celestia,Celestial Advice,[voiceover] I kept you in Canterlot longer than I should have.,,
85,Princess Celestia,Celestial Advice,"Eventually, I realized all the anxiety I felt was because I didn't want you to go.",,
86,Princess Celestia,Fall Weather Friends,"Fall is one of my favorite seasons, so I came to celebrate the Running of the Leaves.",,
87,Princess Celestia,Fall Weather Friends,"Exactly, Twilight. Now, unfortunately, because the two of you were busy tricking each other instead of shaking down leaves, many of the lovely trees of Equestria are still covered.",,
88,Princess Celestia,Fall Weather Friends,Sounds to me that an important lesson was learned.,,
89,Princess Celestia,Fall Weather Friends,"That's all right, Applejack. Anypony can get swept up in the excitement of competition.",,
90,Princess Celestia,"Friendship is Magic, part 2","Twilight Sparkle, my faithful student. I knew you could do it.",,
91,Princess Celestia,"Friendship is Magic, part 2","I told you that you needed to make some friends, nothing more. I saw the signs of Nightmare Moon's return, and I knew it was you who had the magic inside to defeat her, but you could not unleash it until you let true friendship into your heart. Now if only another will as well. Princess Luna!",,
92,Princess Celestia,"Friendship is Magic, part 2","Spike, take a note, please. I, Princess Celestia, hereby decree that the unicorn Twilight Sparkle shall take on a new mission for Equestria. She must continue to study the magic of friendship. She must report to me her findings from her new home in Ponyville.",,
93,Princess Celestia,"Friendship is Magic, part 2","It has been a thousand years since I have seen you like this. Time to put our differences behind us. We were meant to rule together, little sister.",,
94,Princess Celestia,"Friendship is Magic, part 2","Why so glum, my faithful student? Are you not happy that your quest is complete and you can return to your studies in Canterlot?",,
95,Princess Celestia,"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Will you accept my friendship?,,
96,Princess Celestia,Gauntlet of Fire,Be very careful. The Dragon Lands are particularly dangerous for ponies. It would be wise to be discreet.,,
97,Princess Celestia,Gauntlet of Fire,Dragons glow whenever the Dragon Lord has need of them in the Dragon Lands.,,
98,Princess Celestia,Gauntlet of Fire,There's usually some crisis we have to deal with. Somepony always needs our help. But today<U+0097>,,
99,Princess Celestia,Horse Play,"Thank you so much, Twilight! This is what I always knew theater must be about <U+0096> that special stage pony bond of shared trust and honesty.",,
100,Princess Celestia,Horse Play,[flat and stilted] It is time for a new day in Equestria-aaa.,,
