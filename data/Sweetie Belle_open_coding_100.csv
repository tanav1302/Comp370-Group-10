2,Sweetie Belle,28 Pranks Later,Hmm. The sewing machine cake is actually better than the cake cake.,,
3,Sweetie Belle,28 Pranks Later,What happened to all of our friends?,,
4,Sweetie Belle,Appleoosa's Most Wanted,I thought we weren't going to wander off again.,,

6,Sweetie Belle,Appleoosa's Most Wanted,"Come on, we've gone far enough! It's time to go back!",,
7,Sweetie Belle,Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Poor Trouble Shoes. I can't believe those mean judges would laugh at him like that.,,
8,Sweetie Belle,Appleoosa's Most Wanted,That all depends on how you look at it.,,
9,Sweetie Belle,Appleoosa's Most Wanted,"I don't know... All these events look a little, well, dangerous.",,
10,Sweetie Belle,Appleoosa's Most Wanted,But he never wanted to ruin any rodeos! Those were just bad accidents!,,
11,Sweetie Belle,Bloom & Gloom,But maybe we'll see you later.,,
12,Sweetie Belle,Bloom & Gloom,It's lucky we're all scared of the same things. That way we can help and remind each other to just be who we are!,,
13,Sweetie Belle,Bloom & Gloom,"I'm glad she's happy, but I sure wouldn't want to be up to my flank in mane hair all day. Can you imagine getting stuck with a cutie mark you didn't like?",,
14,Sweetie Belle,Bloom & Gloom,"Um, yeah... the thing is...",,
15,Sweetie Belle,Bloom & Gloom,And we certainly don't have time to hang out at an old clubhouse.,,
16,Sweetie Belle,Bloom & Gloom,"Yeah. Apple Bloom, what's this all about?",,

21,Sweetie Belle,Call of the Cutie,"No, it means she's full of potential.",,
22,Sweetie Belle,Call of the Cutie,Let's see if there are any cookies.,,
23,Sweetie Belle,Call of the Cutie,"She could be a great scientist, or an amazing artist, or a famous writer. She could even be mayor of Ponyville someday.",,
24,Sweetie Belle,Campfire Tales,We got to hear legendary stories and go on an adventure.,,
25,Sweetie Belle,Campfire Tales,And I've got the bites to prove it.,,
26,Sweetie Belle,Campfire Tales,"Yup. This time, you only packed three suitcases.",,
27,Sweetie Belle,Campfire Tales,I think she's my favorite legend too.,,
28,Sweetie Belle,Campfire Tales,"How? Our camp was so pretty, and this cave is so... not.",,
29,Sweetie Belle,Campfire Tales,Wait a minute. All by himself?,,
30,Sweetie Belle,Crusaders of the Lost Mark,"Not really, since we kind of overheard you yesterday.",,
31,Sweetie Belle,Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Especially where our playground equipment should be?,,
32,Sweetie Belle,Crusaders of the Lost Mark,"Yeah, and I think that's way more important than worrying about our cutie marks, don't you?",,
33,Sweetie Belle,Crusaders of the Lost Mark,"Well, if that's how you treat your best friend, then I choose Pipsqueak!",,
34,Sweetie Belle,Crusaders of the Lost Mark,And our journey here is never really done,,

39,Sweetie Belle,Family Appreciation Day,Snap out of it. We're here to help you!,,
40,Sweetie Belle,Flight to the Finish,"But that's not true, Scootaloo!",,
41,Sweetie Belle,Flight to the Finish,Ms. Harshwhinny never said anything about that!,,
42,Sweetie Belle,Flight to the Finish,I'm just too tired! I can't keep going!,,
43,Sweetie Belle,Flight to the Finish,I can't believe you're quitting on us!,,
44,Sweetie Belle,Flight to the Finish,But there's one problem! I bet everypony in class is planning to compete!,,
45,Sweetie Belle,Flight to the Finish,"Not without you, Scootaloo.",,
46,Sweetie Belle,Flight to the Finish,I do not like them one bit.,,
47,Sweetie Belle,For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,"I kept meaning to ask her, I really did, but I worked so hard on this play. I wrote it especially for the three of us! I directed it, I'm in it, I made the costumes... It's just that this is really my time to shine doing something completely myself, and I really wanted to keep it that way!",,
48,Sweetie Belle,For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,"[muffled] At least Sapphire Shores won't be all like ""Ooh, who fetched you that red ribbon? Because I don't care about anything else you made. All I care about is that amazing red ribbon!""",,
49,Sweetie Belle,For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,But you have to let us in! I'm Sapphire Shores' designer's sister! You have to believe us!,,
50,Sweetie Belle,For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,"But then I realized I didn't want your future to be ruined forever and ever, so I came back to change it before it was too late! So... here it is. It's all fixed. Please forgive me.",,
51,Sweetie Belle,For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,"No, they were perfect, and that was the whole problem!",,
52,Sweetie Belle,For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,You gotta see this with the cinnamon ribbon! You'll love it!,,
53,Sweetie Belle,For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Admit you made those dresses too good on purpose!,,
54,Sweetie Belle,For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,"Funny, I thought I was the only one who got worried about stuff like that.",,
55,Sweetie Belle,For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,"How could you?! ""Oh, what amazing dresses! Oh, how I love the dresses! Ooh, dresses, dresses, dresses, dresses!""",,
56,Sweetie Belle,For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,"Here we are, the stars of the show!",,
57,Sweetie Belle,For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,"Finally, I was perfect, and then went to the stairs to enter like the belle of the ball. When I finally came out of my room, I found the party going on without me.",,
58,Sweetie Belle,For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,"Forsooth and anon, I cometh forthwith and posthaste with glad tidings, miladies.",,
59,Sweetie Belle,For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,[screams] I don't wanna see any more!,,
60,Sweetie Belle,For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,She's been very busy lately!,,
61,Sweetie Belle,For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Rarity? [gasps] Oh no! The box is... gone? I'm too late! She left for Canterlot!,,

63,Sweetie Belle,For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,"Oh, good! This is just a dream!",,
64,Sweetie Belle,For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,[sighs] I hope everything goes alright for her tomorrow.,,
65,Sweetie Belle,For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,"Look at the stitching, real close.",,
66,Sweetie Belle,For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Don't act like you don't remember. Or are you trying to prove you're a better actress than me too?!,,
67,Sweetie Belle,For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,At least everypony else who was able to stay loved it.,,
68,Sweetie Belle,For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,"Oh, it just came to me... in a dream. I'm sorry I got jealous about those dresses. I know now that you were only trying to help.",,
69,Sweetie Belle,For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,"Yes, good. Not jaw-dropping amazing!",,
70,Sweetie Belle,For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Tomorrow night. For the opening night of our show!,,
71,Sweetie Belle,Forever Filly,"Right... Well, I sure am happy to see you, and spending the day with you does sound like a lot of fun, but... I'm kind of right in the middle of something important. I have responsibilities and...",,
72,Sweetie Belle,Forever Filly,Cutie Mark Crusaders mid-mission here!,,
73,Sweetie Belle,Forever Filly,"Rarity, this is hard for me to say, but... um...",,
74,Sweetie Belle,Forever Filly,"[laughs nervously, sighs] That was, uh... one tasty bite. Still a little hungry, though.",,
75,Sweetie Belle,Forever Filly,"You don't still play with the same toys from when you were a foal, do you?",,
76,Sweetie Belle,Forever Filly,[sighs] I dunno. It's no big deal. This is great.,,
77,Sweetie Belle,Forever Filly,You sure you two can handle our client here?,,
78,Sweetie Belle,Forever Filly,That's just it! I used to! That's not who I am anymore!,,
79,Sweetie Belle,Forever Filly,"You have the CMC guarantee! No matter what it takes, we promise you'll have our full attention.",,
80,Sweetie Belle,Forever Filly,"Okay, Zipporwhill. What do you see?",,
81,Sweetie Belle,Forever Filly,"Hey, Zipporwhill. What are you doing here? Where are Apple Bloom and Scootaloo?",,
82,Sweetie Belle,Forever Filly,"Well, I do have one idea...",,
83,Sweetie Belle,Forever Filly,Huh. I remember it being much bigger.,,
84,Sweetie Belle,Forever Filly,Oh. Right. From when I was a little filly.,,
85,Sweetie Belle,Forever Filly,"Really?! If you still think I like doing this stuff, then maybe you don't know me at all!",,
86,Sweetie Belle,Forever Filly,"Oh, um... I guess another scoop would be fine!",,
87,Sweetie Belle,Forever Filly,Pretty sure it's Zipporwhill. She needs help reconnecting with her cutie mark <U+0096> three puppy paw prints.,,
88,Sweetie Belle,Forever Filly,"I, um, guess I just prefer black box experimental theater.",,
89,Sweetie Belle,Forever Filly,"Aww, Rarity! I love being with you too! That will never change! But... maybe we could just try to do different things together?",,
90,Sweetie Belle,Hard to Say Anything,"Besides, I know exactly what to do! When I was younger, I read all the fairy tales.",,
91,Sweetie Belle,Hard to Say Anything,"We're just gonna have to keep trying! Big Mac, are you ready to take it up a notch?",,
92,Sweetie Belle,Hard to Say Anything,"We're pretty sure she likes you! I mean, she keeps ordering apples just so she can see you again.",,
93,Sweetie Belle,Hard to Say Anything,"Hey, Apple Bloom! Rarity's reorganizing her shop, and look what she found! Old costumes from the talent show!",,
94,Sweetie Belle,Hard to Say Anything,"It doesn't really count when you trick a pony into drinking a love potion, does it?",,
95,Sweetie Belle,Hard to Say Anything,Hey! That's our metaphorical sunset they're riding off into!,,
96,Sweetie Belle,Hard to Say Anything,"Well, I was younger on the way here!",,
97,Sweetie Belle,Hard to Say Anything,"That's an awful long way for a pony to go, isn't it?",,
98,Sweetie Belle,Hard to Say Anything,"It was a long ride! Anyway, as long as we do what the book says, you're pretty much guaranteed a happy ending. Uh, how about this one? ""Rescuing a damsel-pony-in-distress."" That's perfect! Of course, we'll have to improvise without a dragon.",,
99,Sweetie Belle,Hard to Say Anything,So nothing fishy's going on.,,
100,Sweetie Belle,Hard to Say Anything,Yeah. He totally blushed when you brought up how often he's been going to Starlight's old village.,,
