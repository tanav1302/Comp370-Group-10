1,Sweetie Belle,28 Pranks Later,We wanna hit every house in Ponyville!,,
2,Sweetie Belle,28 Pranks Later,Hmm. The sewing machine cake is actually better than the cake cake.,,
3,Sweetie Belle,28 Pranks Later,What happened to all of our friends?,,
4,Sweetie Belle,Appleoosa's Most Wanted,I thought we weren't going to wander off again.,,
5,Sweetie Belle,Appleoosa's Most Wanted,It's actually kind of sweet of him to help us out like this.,,
6,Sweetie Belle,Appleoosa's Most Wanted,"Come on, we've gone far enough! It's time to go back!",,
7,Sweetie Belle,Appleoosa's Most Wanted,Poor Trouble Shoes. I can't believe those mean judges would laugh at him like that.,,
8,Sweetie Belle,Appleoosa's Most Wanted,That all depends on how you look at it.,,
9,Sweetie Belle,Appleoosa's Most Wanted,"I don't know... All these events look a little, well, dangerous.",,
10,Sweetie Belle,Appleoosa's Most Wanted,But he never wanted to ruin any rodeos! Those were just bad accidents!,,
11,Sweetie Belle,Bloom & Gloom,But maybe we'll see you later.,,
12,Sweetie Belle,Bloom & Gloom,It's lucky we're all scared of the same things. That way we can help and remind each other to just be who we are!,,
13,Sweetie Belle,Bloom & Gloom,"I'm glad she's happy, but I sure wouldn't want to be up to my flank in mane hair all day. Can you imagine getting stuck with a cutie mark you didn't like?",,
14,Sweetie Belle,Bloom & Gloom,"Um, yeah... the thing is...",,
15,Sweetie Belle,Bloom & Gloom,And we certainly don't have time to hang out at an old clubhouse.,,
16,Sweetie Belle,Bloom & Gloom,"Yeah. Apple Bloom, what's this all about?",,
17,Sweetie Belle,Brotherhooves Social,Pretty great they're letting you participate even though you're not technically sisters.,,
18,Sweetie Belle,Brotherhooves Social,"It's sweet he wants to help you out like this. Weird, but sweet.",,
19,Sweetie Belle,Brotherhooves Social,"Hey, Apple Bloom, the Social's gonna start in a few hours. Thought you might want to go with us.",,
20,Sweetie Belle,Brotherhooves Social,"That's awful nice of you to say, cousin Orchard Blossom! I've been told before I'm pretty observant.",,
21,Sweetie Belle,Call of the Cutie,"No, it means she's full of potential.",,
22,Sweetie Belle,Call of the Cutie,Let's see if there are any cookies.,,
23,Sweetie Belle,Call of the Cutie,"She could be a great scientist, or an amazing artist, or a famous writer. She could even be mayor of Ponyville someday.",,
24,Sweetie Belle,Campfire Tales,We got to hear legendary stories and go on an adventure.,,
25,Sweetie Belle,Campfire Tales,And I've got the bites to prove it.,,
26,Sweetie Belle,Campfire Tales,"Yup. This time, you only packed three suitcases.",,
27,Sweetie Belle,Campfire Tales,I think she's my favorite legend too.,,
28,Sweetie Belle,Campfire Tales,"How? Our camp was so pretty, and this cave is so... not.",,
29,Sweetie Belle,Campfire Tales,Wait a minute. All by himself?,,
30,Sweetie Belle,Crusaders of the Lost Mark,"Not really, since we kind of overheard you yesterday.",,
31,Sweetie Belle,Crusaders of the Lost Mark,Especially where our playground equipment should be?,,
32,Sweetie Belle,Crusaders of the Lost Mark,"Yeah, and I think that's way more important than worrying about our cutie marks, don't you?",,
33,Sweetie Belle,Crusaders of the Lost Mark,"Well, if that's how you treat your best friend, then I choose Pipsqueak!",,
34,Sweetie Belle,Crusaders of the Lost Mark,And our journey here is never really done,,
35,Sweetie Belle,Equestria Games,We tried to talk him into it...,,
36,Sweetie Belle,Family Appreciation Day,And that gives me an idea!,,
37,Sweetie Belle,Family Appreciation Day,"Well, you can't run off... but maybe somepony else can!",,
38,Sweetie Belle,Family Appreciation Day,Apple Bloom's sick! Looks like she might have to stay home all week!,,
39,Sweetie Belle,Family Appreciation Day,Snap out of it. We're here to help you!,,
40,Sweetie Belle,Flight to the Finish,"But that's not true, Scootaloo!",,
41,Sweetie Belle,Flight to the Finish,Ms. Harshwhinny never said anything about that!,,
42,Sweetie Belle,Flight to the Finish,I'm just too tired! I can't keep going!,,
43,Sweetie Belle,Flight to the Finish,I can't believe you're quitting on us!,,
44,Sweetie Belle,Flight to the Finish,But there's one problem! I bet everypony in class is planning to compete!,,
45,Sweetie Belle,Flight to the Finish,"Not without you, Scootaloo.",,
46,Sweetie Belle,Flight to the Finish,I do not like them one bit.,,
47,Sweetie Belle,For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,"I kept meaning to ask her, I really did, but I worked so hard on this play. I wrote it especially for the three of us! I directed it, I'm in it, I made the costumes... It's just that this is really my time to shine doing something completely myself, and I really wanted to keep it that way!",,
48,Sweetie Belle,For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,"[muffled] At least Sapphire Shores won't be all like ""Ooh, who fetched you that red ribbon? Because I don't care about anything else you made. All I care about is that amazing red ribbon!""",,
49,Sweetie Belle,For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,But you have to let us in! I'm Sapphire Shores' designer's sister! You have to believe us!,,
50,Sweetie Belle,For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,"But then I realized I didn't want your future to be ruined forever and ever, so I came back to change it before it was too late! So... here it is. It's all fixed. Please forgive me.",,
51,Sweetie Belle,For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,"No, they were perfect, and that was the whole problem!",,
52,Sweetie Belle,For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,You gotta see this with the cinnamon ribbon! You'll love it!,,
53,Sweetie Belle,For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Admit you made those dresses too good on purpose!,,
54,Sweetie Belle,For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,"Funny, I thought I was the only one who got worried about stuff like that.",,
55,Sweetie Belle,For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,"How could you?! ""Oh, what amazing dresses! Oh, how I love the dresses! Ooh, dresses, dresses, dresses, dresses!""",,
56,Sweetie Belle,For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,"Here we are, the stars of the show!",,
57,Sweetie Belle,For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,"Finally, I was perfect, and then went to the stairs to enter like the belle of the ball. When I finally came out of my room, I found the party going on without me.",,
58,Sweetie Belle,For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,"Forsooth and anon, I cometh forthwith and posthaste with glad tidings, miladies.",,
59,Sweetie Belle,For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,[screams] I don't wanna see any more!,,
60,Sweetie Belle,For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,She's been very busy lately!,,
61,Sweetie Belle,For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Rarity? [gasps] Oh no! The box is... gone? I'm too late! She left for Canterlot!,,
62,Sweetie Belle,For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,"Wait, come back! Luna? Can you hear me? Thank you for what you did! Help, Luna! Luuuna!",,
63,Sweetie Belle,For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,"Oh, good! This is just a dream!",,
64,Sweetie Belle,For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,[sighs] I hope everything goes alright for her tomorrow.,,
65,Sweetie Belle,For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,"Look at the stitching, real close.",,
66,Sweetie Belle,For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Don't act like you don't remember. Or are you trying to prove you're a better actress than me too?!,,
67,Sweetie Belle,For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,At least everypony else who was able to stay loved it.,,
68,Sweetie Belle,For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,"Oh, it just came to me... in a dream. I'm sorry I got jealous about those dresses. I know now that you were only trying to help.",,
69,Sweetie Belle,For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,"Yes, good. Not jaw-dropping amazing!",,
70,Sweetie Belle,For Whom the Sweetie Belle Toils,Tomorrow night. For the opening night of our show!,,
71,Sweetie Belle,Forever Filly,"Right... Well, I sure am happy to see you, and spending the day with you does sound like a lot of fun, but... I'm kind of right in the middle of something important. I have responsibilities and...",,
72,Sweetie Belle,Forever Filly,Cutie Mark Crusaders mid-mission here!,,
73,Sweetie Belle,Forever Filly,"Rarity, this is hard for me to say, but... um...",,
74,Sweetie Belle,Forever Filly,"[laughs nervously, sighs] That was, uh... one tasty bite. Still a little hungry, though.",,
75,Sweetie Belle,Forever Filly,"You don't still play with the same toys from when you were a foal, do you?",,
76,Sweetie Belle,Forever Filly,[sighs] I dunno. It's no big deal. This is great.,,
77,Sweetie Belle,Forever Filly,You sure you two can handle our client here?,,
78,Sweetie Belle,Forever Filly,That's just it! I used to! That's not who I am anymore!,,
79,Sweetie Belle,Forever Filly,"You have the CMC guarantee! No matter what it takes, we promise you'll have our full attention.",,
80,Sweetie Belle,Forever Filly,"Okay, Zipporwhill. What do you see?",,
81,Sweetie Belle,Forever Filly,"Hey, Zipporwhill. What are you doing here? Where are Apple Bloom and Scootaloo?",,
82,Sweetie Belle,Forever Filly,"Well, I do have one idea...",,
83,Sweetie Belle,Forever Filly,Huh. I remember it being much bigger.,,
84,Sweetie Belle,Forever Filly,Oh. Right. From when I was a little filly.,,
85,Sweetie Belle,Forever Filly,"Really?! If you still think I like doing this stuff, then maybe you don't know me at all!",,
86,Sweetie Belle,Forever Filly,"Oh, um... I guess another scoop would be fine!",,
87,Sweetie Belle,Forever Filly,Pretty sure it's Zipporwhill. She needs help reconnecting with her cutie mark <U+0096> three puppy paw prints.,,
88,Sweetie Belle,Forever Filly,"I, um, guess I just prefer black box experimental theater.",,
89,Sweetie Belle,Forever Filly,"Aww, Rarity! I love being with you too! That will never change! But... maybe we could just try to do different things together?",,
90,Sweetie Belle,Hard to Say Anything,"Besides, I know exactly what to do! When I was younger, I read all the fairy tales.",,
91,Sweetie Belle,Hard to Say Anything,"We're just gonna have to keep trying! Big Mac, are you ready to take it up a notch?",,
92,Sweetie Belle,Hard to Say Anything,"We're pretty sure she likes you! I mean, she keeps ordering apples just so she can see you again.",,
93,Sweetie Belle,Hard to Say Anything,"Hey, Apple Bloom! Rarity's reorganizing her shop, and look what she found! Old costumes from the talent show!",,
94,Sweetie Belle,Hard to Say Anything,"It doesn't really count when you trick a pony into drinking a love potion, does it?",,
95,Sweetie Belle,Hard to Say Anything,Hey! That's our metaphorical sunset they're riding off into!,,
96,Sweetie Belle,Hard to Say Anything,"Well, I was younger on the way here!",,
97,Sweetie Belle,Hard to Say Anything,"That's an awful long way for a pony to go, isn't it?",,
98,Sweetie Belle,Hard to Say Anything,"It was a long ride! Anyway, as long as we do what the book says, you're pretty much guaranteed a happy ending. Uh, how about this one? ""Rescuing a damsel-pony-in-distress."" That's perfect! Of course, we'll have to improvise without a dragon.",,
99,Sweetie Belle,Hard to Say Anything,So nothing fishy's going on.,,
100,Sweetie Belle,Hard to Say Anything,Yeah. He totally blushed when you brought up how often he's been going to Starlight's old village.,,
101,Sweetie Belle,Hearts and Hooves Day,"We may have given you the teeny-tiniest bit of love potion... that may have turned out to actually be a love poison, and you may have gone just a teeny-tiniest bit nutty.",,
102,Sweetie Belle,Hearts and Hooves Day,Now we just need to keep them apart. I'll keep Miss Cheerilee occupied. You two do the same with Big Mac.,,
103,Sweetie Belle,Hearts and Hooves Day,I think they're gonna drink it.,,
104,Sweetie Belle,Hearts and Hooves Day,"Miss Cheerilee, are you alright?",,
105,Sweetie Belle,Hearts and Hooves Day,"If we can get Big Mac and Miss Cheerilee in a really romantic setting, I bet she'll ask him.",,
106,Sweetie Belle,Hearts and Hooves Day,This one looks nice. Better try it on though.,,
107,Sweetie Belle,Hearts and Hooves Day,They aren't really gonna get married. They're just gonna get ready to get married.,,
108,Sweetie Belle,Hearts and Hooves Day,"Well nothing's wrong with this one, He seems alright...",,
109,Sweetie Belle,Hearts and Hooves Day,How could somepony as amazing as you not have a very special somepony on Hearts and Hooves Day?,,
110,Sweetie Belle,Hearts and Hooves Day,Now it can't be just anypony. Miss Cheerilee is one of the best mares in Ponyville. She deserves to have one of the best stallions as her very special somepony.,,
111,Sweetie Belle,Hearts and Hooves Day,"Punch! We made punch. We were gonna set up a stand and try to sell it but, heh, we needed somepony to taste-test it first.",,
112,Sweetie Belle,Hearts and Hooves Day,I'm more than all right. I've just come up with the best idea ever. We're gonna find Miss Cheerilee a very special somepony.,,
113,Sweetie Belle,Hearts and Hooves Day,"If we can keep Miss Cheerilee and Big Mac from looking into each other's eyes for one full hour, the love curse will be broken.",,
114,Sweetie Belle,Hearts and Hooves Day,"[sigh] Either way, we failed.",,
115,Sweetie Belle,Hearts and Hooves Day,"Gosh, you two are so in love, the next thing you know, you'll be getting married.",,
116,Sweetie Belle,Hearts and Hooves Day,Of course it will work. They're perfect for each other.,,
117,Sweetie Belle,Hearts and Hooves Day,What's wrong? Where's Apple Bloom? Where's Big Mac?,,
118,Sweetie Belle,Hearts and Hooves Day,Too strangely obsessed with tubs of jelly.,,
119,Sweetie Belle,Hearts and Hooves Day,With her new very special somepony.,,
120,Sweetie Belle,Hearts and Hooves Day,"I... don't suppose we could borrow that book for a little while, do ya?",,
121,Sweetie Belle,Hearts and Hooves Day,"We did it girls, We've found the one, Who will send our teacher's heart aflutter!",,
122,Sweetie Belle,Just for Sidekicks,"Awww, little fluffy Angel Bunny-kins! You're so cute! The natural weaves in his fluff are to die for!",,
123,Sweetie Belle,Just for Sidekicks,"I wish I were dressed for it, but still... [squealing] THE CRYSTAL EMPIRE!",,
124,Sweetie Belle,Just for Sidekicks,Isn't Angel just the cutest thing you've ever seen?!,,
125,Sweetie Belle,Just for Sidekicks,There has to be a better solution!,,
126,Sweetie Belle,Just for Sidekicks,Without seeing the palace!,,
127,Sweetie Belle,Lesson Zero,I really like her... mane?,,
128,Sweetie Belle,Lesson Zero,I really... like her... mane.,,
129,Sweetie Belle,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,[singsong] We're plus-ones!,,
130,Sweetie Belle,Marks and Recreation,"Rumble, stop! That's just not true!",,
131,Sweetie Belle,Marks and Recreation,Trying to find out what you're meant to do can be frustrating. You remember how long it took us to get our cutie marks?,,
132,Sweetie Belle,Marks and Recreation,The Cutie Mark Crusaders are pleased to announce today's special guest <U+0096> Thunderlane!,,
133,Sweetie Belle,Marks and Recreation,Wow. I can't believe we got a cutie mark on the first day!,,
134,Sweetie Belle,Marks and Recreation,[yelling] Cutie marks... make you... special!,,
135,Sweetie Belle,Marks and Recreation,"Well, that certainly is... round.",,
136,Sweetie Belle,Marks and Recreation,Everypony wants to know what they're meant to do!,,
137,Sweetie Belle,Marks and Recreation,"Kettle Corn, you covered your cutie mark?!",,
138,Sweetie Belle,Marks and Recreation,That would be perfect! We'd save time and they could help each other!,,
139,Sweetie Belle,Marks and Recreation,That's silly. Having a cutie mark doesn't mean you can't do other things.,,
140,Sweetie Belle,Marks and Recreation,"I can't believe Rumble isn't interested in getting his cutie mark either, but we can't force him.",,
141,Sweetie Belle,Marks and Recreation,"Well, we're excited too! At Cutie Mark Day Camp, you'll be able to try all kinds of things!",,
142,Sweetie Belle,Marks and Recreation,We know you'll get your cutie mark. Everypony does.,,
143,Sweetie Belle,Marks for Effort,Can't you just give us a chance?,,
144,Sweetie Belle,Marks for Effort,We wanna learn friendship!,,
145,Sweetie Belle,Marks for Effort,Aww. She looks so sad. We better go see what's wrong.,,
146,Sweetie Belle,Marks for Effort,Or how Twilight could blame us for it!,,
147,Sweetie Belle,Marks for Effort,"Green, purple, yellow. And one more purple. Whew. Sorting all those took longer than I thought.",,
148,Sweetie Belle,Marks for Effort,At least she likes her present?,,
149,Sweetie Belle,Marks for Effort,That sounds like a closet.,,
150,Sweetie Belle,Marks for Effort,"[stiltedly] You are so careless! [quietly] Good plan, Apple Bloom!",,
151,Sweetie Belle,Marks for Effort,[whispering] Rarity says there's never been a school like it!,,
152,Sweetie Belle,Marks for Effort,Please can I go to Twilight's school?!,,
153,Sweetie Belle,On Your Marks,"Don't worry, you'll be just fine!",,
154,Sweetie Belle,On Your Marks,A place where we faced all kinds of cutie mark problems!,,
155,Sweetie Belle,On Your Marks,Like when there's something one of us wants to do that the others don't.,,
156,Sweetie Belle,On Your Marks,"Oh! I'm sorry, Apple Bloom. I was distracted by the radiance of my cutie mark... Did you say something?",,
157,Sweetie Belle,On Your Marks,I don't think Rarity would let me travel to the far reaches of Equestria looking for cutie mark problems.,,
158,Sweetie Belle,On Your Marks,The problem boils down to this <U+0096> we don't need to go out and do things anymore to get our cutie marks.,,
159,Sweetie Belle,On Your Marks,I can't believe you tried all this stuff and didn't find one thing you liked!,,
160,Sweetie Belle,On Your Marks,"Well, we used to only do stuff to get our cutie marks or fulfill our destiny, but now we don't have to.",,
161,Sweetie Belle,On Your Marks,So... what's your cutie mark problem?,,
162,Sweetie Belle,On Your Marks,"Huh. So now that we don't have to do stuff to get our cutie marks, what is it that the Cutie Mark Crusaders actually do?",,
163,Sweetie Belle,On Your Marks,And it's totally normal to feel confused and maybe even a little lost. But being a blank flank is nothing to be ashamed of.,,
164,Sweetie Belle,On Your Marks,Just as soon as you figure out what it is.,,
165,Sweetie Belle,On Your Marks,"[tapping with baton] And a-one, and a-two, and a-one two three!",,
166,Sweetie Belle,One Bad Apple,We need to talk to Applejack.,,
167,Sweetie Belle,One Bad Apple,I'm just so excited I could burst!,,
168,Sweetie Belle,One Bad Apple,We could always tell Applejack.,,
169,Sweetie Belle,One Bad Apple,"And we figured out you were just doing it to avoid getting picked on in Ponyville. But, by then... we were the ones being bullies. And... Oh, why does life have to be so ironic?!",,
170,Sweetie Belle,One Bad Apple,"Isn't it smashing? No! I-I didn't mean smashing! I mean... Isn't it a hit? No! No, I- No! No hitting! I meant<U+0096>",,
171,Sweetie Belle,One Bad Apple,This is gonna be the best week of your life!,,
172,Sweetie Belle,One Bad Apple,Teach her to fool with the Cutie Mark Crusaders!,,
173,Sweetie Belle,One Bad Apple,We have to tell Applejack!,,
174,Sweetie Belle,One Bad Apple,The Summer Harvest Parade's going on while you're here! You'll get to ride in a float!,,
175,Sweetie Belle,One Bad Apple,But it's booby tra<U+0096>,,
176,Sweetie Belle,One Bad Apple,"[tired] Good, 'cause we'd better get out of here before Babs finds us.",,
177,Sweetie Belle,Owl's Well That Ends Well,"Hey, everypony! The show is starting!",,
178,Sweetie Belle,Ponyville Confidential,Your friends would wanna read the Foal Free Press?,,
179,Sweetie Belle,Ponyville Confidential,Scootaloo? Do you have anything?,,
180,Sweetie Belle,Ponyville Confidential,Are you snooping through my saddlebag?,,
181,Sweetie Belle,Ponyville Confidential,"But this could be our last chance to earn our cutie marks! If we really are supposed to be journalists, isn't it worth a little grief?",,
182,Sweetie Belle,Ponyville Confidential,"We gave up too quickly, girls. Forget trying to squeeze stories out of this school. We need to expand!",,
183,Sweetie Belle,Ponyville Confidential,Can you believe Featherweight got his cutie mark? Featherweight! Before us!,,
184,Sweetie Belle,Ponyville Confidential,Can you please keep it down with all the laughter? I'm trying to<U+0096> hey!,,
185,Sweetie Belle,Ponyville Confidential,"We're sorry, Diamond Tiara, but we've made our decision.",,
186,Sweetie Belle,Ponyville Confidential,"To the citizens of Ponyville,",,
187,Sweetie Belle,Ponyville Confidential,"We couldn't fit all of our names, so we decided to create one for all three of us.",,
188,Sweetie Belle,Ponyville Confidential,"[giggles] Hey, Featherweight, c'mere! [giggles] Take a few pictures of this, then meet me during lunch. Girls, I have our story.",,
189,Sweetie Belle,Ponyville Confidential,We'll need to tell Featherweight to start working overtime.,,
190,Sweetie Belle,Ponyville Confidential,But the gossip we've been printing is hurting everypony's feelings!,,
191,Sweetie Belle,Ponyville Confidential,We've ruined all of our friendships and we still don't have our cutie marks!,,
192,Sweetie Belle,Ponyville Confidential,What's an editor-in-chief?,,
193,Sweetie Belle,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,"Rarity, you have to help me! I think something's wrong with my horn!",,
194,Sweetie Belle,School Raze - Part 2,Cozy Glow did all of this? How? Why?,,
195,Sweetie Belle,School Raze - Part 2,What happened?! Is everything all right?! Where's Cozy Glow?!,,
196,Sweetie Belle,School Raze - Part 2,"But Starlight's trapped here, and there's no way to get word to Celestia or anypony else!",,
197,Sweetie Belle,Sisterhooves Social,"Geez Louise, can't I do anything right?",,
198,Sweetie Belle,Sisterhooves Social,"[mimicking Rarity] Why, it's smashing!",,
199,Sweetie Belle,Sisterhooves Social,That sounds like the perfect way for us to hang out! Rarity will think it's an excellent idea.,,
200,Sweetie Belle,Sisterhooves Social,"Oh hello, un-sister. What are you doing here? Better be careful, you might get some dust on you.",,
201,Sweetie Belle,Sisterhooves Social,It's not just the Social. She thinks I'm uncouth.,,
202,Sweetie Belle,Sisterhooves Social,I just wanted to do something nice for my sister.,,
203,Sweetie Belle,Sisterhooves Social,"So, we did the whole competition... together?",,
204,Sweetie Belle,Sisterhooves Social,Rarity! I thought you said I was gonna help!,,
205,Sweetie Belle,Sisterhooves Social,I'll go with you and help!,,
206,Sweetie Belle,Sisterhooves Social,"No problem, I'll make myself useful!",,
207,Sweetie Belle,Sisterhooves Social,"Thank you, Applejack! You were amazing! I don't even care that we didn't win. This was so much fun! Huh? Rarity?! Wait, where's Applejack?",,
208,Sweetie Belle,Sisterhooves Social,A sister is someone who loves and takes care of another sister. Applejack's a real sister.,,
209,Sweetie Belle,Sisterhooves Social,You mean... you were all in on it?,,
210,Sweetie Belle,Sisterhooves Social,"Um, okay. Ow! You're right, it is hard work.",,
211,Sweetie Belle,Sisterhooves Social,I never got in trouble for drawing. Hmm. This needs something...,,
212,Sweetie Belle,Sisterhooves Social,You sure you want me to help? I just mess everything up!,,
213,Sweetie Belle,Sisterhooves Social,"But every time I make a mess, you get upset!",,
214,Sweetie Belle,Sisterhooves Social,"But, I thought it would make you happy!",,
215,Sweetie Belle,Sisterhooves Social,"Hi, Rarity! I made a special drawing for y<U+0096>",,
216,Sweetie Belle,Sisterhooves Social,"That's the last word Rarity would use. [mimicking Rarity] Oh my, what a repulsive monstrosity! This thing needs a head to toe makeover!",,
217,Sweetie Belle,Sisterhooves Social,"Hm! You want me to go home with you, so we can do what you wanna do?",,
218,Sweetie Belle,Sleepless in Ponyville,See? Told you she'd wanna go.,,
219,Sweetie Belle,Sleepless in Ponyville,I call sister teams! Last herd to make it to the falls is a moldy carrot!,,
220,Sweetie Belle,Sleepless in Ponyville,And I'll get Rarity to come too! Rarity loves camping!,,
221,Sweetie Belle,Slice of Life,"Maybe it's just a friendship problem, and it'll all be cleared up in half an hour or so.",,
222,Sweetie Belle,Somepony to Watch Over Me,"Why, that sounds delightful!",,
223,Sweetie Belle,Somepony to Watch Over Me,"Totally. Even though it could change everything for you, forever and ever!",,
224,Sweetie Belle,Somepony to Watch Over Me,It must've been hours ago.,,
225,Sweetie Belle,Stare Master,"Yup. And look. I lined them with this special gold silk. It took sooo long to make, but I think it adds just the right touch, don't you?",,
226,Sweetie Belle,Stare Master,And... look what I made us!,,
227,Sweetie Belle,Stare Master,"But you could go with us and we could catch those creatures. We could be, umm... creature catchers!",,
228,Sweetie Belle,Stare Master,Who wants a picture of a hammer on their flank anyway?,,
229,Sweetie Belle,Stare Master,We're sorry we snuck out of the house and into the forest.,,
230,Sweetie Belle,Stare Master,"Okay, so what kind of crusading do we do next?",,
231,Sweetie Belle,Stare Master,"Um, I-I'll just go and stand over there, where I'll be... out of the way.",,
232,Sweetie Belle,Stare Master,Hush now! Quiet now! It's time to lay your sleepy head! Said hush now! Quiet now! It's time to go to bed!,,
233,Sweetie Belle,Stare Master,"And, and, and, we, um<U+0097> yeah! What they said!",,
234,Sweetie Belle,Stare Master,Um ... that doesn't look like a table.,,
235,Sweetie Belle,Stare Master,Thanks to that stare of yours.,,
236,Sweetie Belle,Stare Master,Are you sure I can't help? I could<U+0097>,,
237,Sweetie Belle,Stare Master,Cutie Mark Crusader chicken herders! Yay!,,

239,Sweetie Belle,Surf and/or Turf,Thank goodness that the Cutie Mark Crusaders have begun To give you hope and help you to decide,,
240,Sweetie Belle,Surf and/or Turf,"Well, it's obvious, isn't it? Mount Aris is the best of all possible worlds. Pro <U+0096> it's beautiful. Con <U+0096> too far from Equestria. I think that pretty much sums it up.",,
241,Sweetie Belle,Surf and/or Turf,Woo-hoo! Yeah! Awesome! I love this!,,
242,Sweetie Belle,Surf and/or Turf,Shhh! It's rude to ask a question like that!,,
243,Sweetie Belle,Surf and/or Turf,...we just ended up confusing you more. It's all our fault.,,
244,Sweetie Belle,Surf and/or Turf,"You really don't need to come with us, Twilight. We can take care of this mission just fine on our own.",,
245,Sweetie Belle,Surf and/or Turf,"Huh. Not much sunlight down here, is there?",,
246,Sweetie Belle,Surf and/or Turf,This is absolutely the best place ever! You are so lucky!,,
247,Sweetie Belle,Surf and/or Turf,Ohhhh. I-I didn't know that.,,
248,Sweetie Belle,Surf and/or Turf,We thought we'd get every creature together for a picnic on the beach.,,
249,Sweetie Belle,Surf and/or Turf,Wow! That's almost... off the table!,,
250,Sweetie Belle,Surf and/or Turf,"I don't know if I'd like being a Hippogriff. Part bird, part pony...",,
251,Sweetie Belle,The Break Up Break Down,It seems like everypony's got somepony special but us.,,
252,Sweetie Belle,The Break Up Break Down,"[chomp] [reading] ""Happy Hearts and Hooves Day, Sugar Belle. Meet me<U+0097>""",,
253,Sweetie Belle,The Break Up Break Down,"Oh, it's funny. I've been sitting here feeling sorry for myself for not having a special pony on Hearts and Hooves Day. But remembering all the fun we had, I think I have two special ponies <U+0096> my two best friends.",,
254,Sweetie Belle,The Break Up Break Down,"[to Snips and Snails] Happy Hearts and Hooves Day! Did you boys happen to send any packages to me recently? It's okay to say no! I won't be offended! [whispering] Please say no, please say no, please say no.",,
255,Sweetie Belle,The Break Up Break Down,But we worked so hard on this chart. I think we've almost cracked it. If you could just<U+0097>,,
256,Sweetie Belle,The Cart Before the Ponies,Doesn't look like any of us ended up with what we wanted.,,
257,Sweetie Belle,The Cart Before the Ponies,"Um, Miss Cheerilee? That sounds a bit over our heads.",,
258,Sweetie Belle,The Cart Before the Ponies,"First they built the carts, now they're gonna drive them?!",,
259,Sweetie Belle,The Cart Before the Ponies,"I'm sure they meant ""our"" carts. Like, the team cart, right?",,
260,Sweetie Belle,The Cart Before the Ponies,Wow! Have you seen what the carts used to look like in the olden days?,,
261,Sweetie Belle,The Cart Before the Ponies,Sure! The race is the best part!,,
262,Sweetie Belle,The Cart Before the Ponies,And I can win the award for most traditional!,,
263,Sweetie Belle,The Cart Before the Ponies,"The Derby was supposed to be for us, not the three of you! Now you've ruined it for everypony!",,
264,Sweetie Belle,The Cart Before the Ponies,You? Second in most creative? To whom?!,,
265,Sweetie Belle,The Cart Before the Ponies,"Well, it doesn't have to be yellow. But I really do love the old-timey style. Like this.",,
266,Sweetie Belle,The Cutie Mark Chronicles,"Maybe we should do something less dangerous, like pillow testing or flower sniffing.",,
267,Sweetie Belle,The Cutie Mark Chronicles,"Oh, come on. She's just being Pinkie Pie.",,
268,Sweetie Belle,The Cutie Mark Chronicles,"[gulp] Are you sure about this, Scootaloo? I've never even heard of a pony zip lining before.",,
269,Sweetie Belle,The Cutie Mark Chronicles,"We're happy for you, Twilight.",,
270,Sweetie Belle,The Cutie Pox,The Bowling Dolls! That's it!,,
271,Sweetie Belle,The Cutie Pox,Yeah! So what if your talent is potion making?,,
272,Sweetie Belle,The Cutie Pox,"You're too kind, Apple Bloom.",,
273,Sweetie Belle,The Cutie Pox,"[muffled] Whooo! [spits out bag] I mean, yaay!",,
274,Sweetie Belle,The Cutie Pox,A treat from Sugarcube Corner will cheer you up.,,
275,Sweetie Belle,The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Guess we'll never know for sure unless we give it a try.,,
276,Sweetie Belle,The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Aaaaand... she's off again.,,
277,Sweetie Belle,The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,We just can't figure out what one thing you're supposed to do.,,
278,Sweetie Belle,The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,I thought we could help anypony.,,
279,Sweetie Belle,The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,"But since we are the Cutie Mark Crusaders, we made you one anyway. Behold!",,
280,Sweetie Belle,The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,"Um, I think maybe that could've been clearer.",,
281,Sweetie Belle,The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Excited? But whatever for?,,
282,Sweetie Belle,The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,"Though I'm pretty sure it doesn't happen to griffons. Or if it does, we've never ever heard of it.",,
283,Sweetie Belle,The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,"Gabby, we're your friends. Why in Equestria are you running away from us?",,
284,Sweetie Belle,The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,Or how about singing? I just love to sing! La-la-la-la!,,
285,Sweetie Belle,The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,"Crusaders, this is terrible! Gabby really believed in us. And now, we're gonna let her down.",,
286,Sweetie Belle,The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,"Now, Scootaloo, you do know there will always be challenges? Someday, somepony might even come to us with a problem that even we can't handle. Like, say...",,
287,Sweetie Belle,The Fault in Our Cutie Marks,So Scootaloo's keeping Petunia busy like you asked. What did you two want to talk about?,,
288,Sweetie Belle,The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows,Heard any good gossip today?,,
289,Sweetie Belle,The Show Stoppers,Then it's settled! Let's get started.,,
290,Sweetie Belle,The Show Stoppers,You know what would be the best? If we won and we got our cutie marks.,,
291,Sweetie Belle,The Show Stoppers,They all say that you will get your mark When the time is really right,,
292,Sweetie Belle,The Show Stoppers,There? Where? What? I don't even know what we're doing.,,
293,Sweetie Belle,The Show Stoppers,"Oh, it can't be that bad. ""With our cutie marks we'll rock Equestria. We use our stomachs to... digestia""? Umm... Well... These are... um... good, but... How about after ""we fight the fight""... There is nothing that we fear We'll have to figure out what we'll do next 'Til our cutie marks are here",,
294,Sweetie Belle,The Show Stoppers,"Come back! Come back! Uh. Dumb fabric. Hey, Scoot! How's the song going?",,
295,Sweetie Belle,The Show Stoppers,"What? No way I'm singing in front of a crowd. Twilight said to do something we like to do, and I'd like to be like my big sister, and she's a designer.",,
296,Sweetie Belle,The Show Stoppers,"No, no, no. You see, in the theater it's considered bad luck to say ""good luck"". So you say ""break a leg"" instead.",,
297,Sweetie Belle,The Show Stoppers,[moan] I'll never be a designer like my sister Rarity.,,
298,Sweetie Belle,The Show Stoppers,I've never been here before.,,
299,Sweetie Belle,The Show Stoppers,Me too. You think we're ready?,,
300,Sweetie Belle,The Show Stoppers,"Yeah. Instructions on how to use six wooden planks, four-by-eight plywood, a box of nails, four cans of paint, and four brushes.",,
301,Sweetie Belle,The Show Stoppers,Me too. Um... so what are we doing again?,,
302,Sweetie Belle,Twilight Time,"Oh, we're gonna look sad all right...",,
303,Sweetie Belle,Twilight Time,This way! I know a shortcut!,,
304,Sweetie Belle,Twilight Time,"Oh, yeah?! Well, I don't have to go all the way to Manehattan to hang out with the famous and super-cool ponies! Me and my friends hang out with Princess Twilight all the time!",,
305,Sweetie Belle,Twilight Time,[gasps] [out of breath] We... made... it... Quick! Knock on<U+0096>,,
306,Sweetie Belle,Twilight Time,"Um... a-actually, no. We didn't have a chance to ask Twilight, so<U+0096>",,
307,Sweetie Belle,Twilight Time,What's tricky about inviting Twilight out for a meal thanking her for all the nice things she's done for us? Seems like the least we can do for the princess!,,
308,Sweetie Belle,Twilight Time,Okay! But stay out of sight!,,
309,Sweetie Belle,Twilight Time,But don't you get it? They'll have to learn something too!,,
310,Sweetie Belle,Twilight Time,"When I told you when you could come eyeball the princess at one of her favorite hangouts, I said only two or three of you, tops!",,
311,Sweetie Belle,Twilight Time,"Apple Bloom doesn't have her apple seed with her, so she'll just grab an apple from the kitchen. And I will begin by using my magic to lift this broom!",,
312,Sweetie Belle,Twilight Time,"I guess Twilight must not be so super-upset anymore, 'cause she's letting us do a diary entry like our sisters do. Boy, did we get our priorities messed up. We started acting special because we were friends with someone special. We almost forgot the real reason she's special <U+0096> because she's our friend. But she forgave us, and, like magic, things are good as new! That's the kind of magic I really want to get good at, now that I'm getting so good at the other kind.",,
313,Sweetie Belle,Twilight Time,"Hey, come to think of it, if we get really good at the stuff Twilight's teaching us, we could be the big shots around here for a change! Hmm...",,
314,Sweetie Belle,Twilight Time,Nope. Ready to give it a shot!,,
315,Sweetie Belle,Twilight Time,"Unfortunately, since we don't have Scootaloo's unicycle parts, she'll take apart and put back together one of the scooters from outside.",,
316,Sweetie Belle,Twilight Time,We wanted our time together just as a way to be with you and learn new things. Really and truly!,,
317,Sweetie Belle,Twilight Time,Of awesome! Don't you see? We're really and truly and certifiably the biggest of the big shots in school right now!,,
318,Sweetie Belle,Twilight Time,"Now remember, Twilight takes this time out with us so we can learn stuff.",,
319,Sweetie Belle,Twilight Time,"They all think we're the greatest, because we're their ticket to get time with Ponyville's newest and biggest celebrity, Princess Twilight!",,
