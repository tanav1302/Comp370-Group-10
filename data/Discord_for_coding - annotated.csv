4,Discord,A Matter of Principals,"Fine! From now on, I won't try to help. At! All!",Friendship & Relationships,
5,Discord,A Matter of Principals,"To fill in for Twilight, of course, as head-draconequus. I seem to recall a whole song about how this school is where you make your own rules. Now, who better at that than me?",Identity & Personal Growth,
6,Discord,A Matter of Principals,"My problem? How is the fact that Twilight decided to put an incompetent, power-hungry unicorn in charge of her school my problem?!",Authority & Leadership,

8,Discord,A Matter of Principals,Uh... [stuttering] I don't know what you're getting at.,Friendship & Relationships,
9,Discord,A Matter of Principals,"Oh, I better take this. Hello?",Friendship & Relationships,

13,Discord,A Matter of Principals,"Oh, he did not! And what did you say?",Friendship & Relationships,

15,Discord,A Matter of Principals,"[chuckles] Well, with a few surprises.",Authority & Leadership,
16,Discord,Celestial Advice,"Or we could go cause a little mischief. I know a trick that'll turn Celestia's castle into cheese. Do you think it's a ""gouda"" idea? [laughs] That's just the first of many cheese jokes if we go down this path.",Friendship & Relationships,
17,Discord,Celestial Advice,"You already planned the perfect moment during the party to make the grand announcement to everypony about your plan. Brava, Twilight! I can't wait to tell your plan to Fluttershy and the others!",Friendship & Relationships,
18,Discord,Celestial Advice,"No, no. Clearly, Starlight is beyond basic friendship lessons. She just won a medal, for Equestria's sake. I thought you were joking. You are joking, right?",Friendship & Relationships,
19,Discord,Celestial Advice,"You weren't coming up with a plan just now, were you? Oh, dear. This could be pretty embarrassing for you.",Friendship & Relationships,
20,Discord,Celestial Advice,Psst! I see what you're doing.,Friendship & Relationships,
21,Discord,Celestial Advice,"Probably because you're not as close as you think you are. [laughs] Just kidding. She wanted it to be a big surprise. Just between us, she's getting ready to make a big announcement!",Friendship & Relationships,
22,Discord,Celestial Advice,Darn it. I was hoping you would send her to my realm. We could've been roomies. Way to not pick up what I was putting down.,Friendship & Relationships,
23,Discord,Celestial Advice,"Oh, Starlight. Princess Twilight has something very important to tell us. Well, just you, really, but I'm nosy and I want to hear.",Identity & Personal Growth,
24,Discord,Celestial Advice,"Yes, Starlight is student of the year, isn't she? She has so much potential. So, what are we going to do with her? And by ""we"", I definitely mean ""you"". Being her mentor and all that, her destiny falls squarely on your haunches.",Friendship & Relationships,
25,Discord,Celestial Advice,"Yes, because you did it all by yourself.","History, Lore, & Magic",
26,Discord,Celestial Advice,Anytime. I really do love being helpful.,Identity & Personal Growth,
27,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"And that's why you're the party expert. Thank you, Pinkie Pie. I feel so much better now.",Friendship & Relationships,
28,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"[sips tea] It did rain the other day, however.",Nature & Animals,
29,Discord,Discordant Harmony,How boring. Pass. Hold on! Ginseng tea! Now that sounds promising. What does it sing? I'm partial to something upbeat and jazzy.,Food & Drink,
30,Discord,Discordant Harmony,Do something chaotic? I'll try...,Identity & Personal Growth,
31,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Okay, let's give these conversation cards a whirl. [clears throat, reading] ""It is very nice to see you today."" ""Have you read any good books lately?"" ""Your garden looks positively lovely.""",Nature & Animals,
32,Discord,Discordant Harmony,This is what you were hoping for? But this is the complete opposite of your tea parties.,Food & Drink,
33,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Make Fluttershy feel comfortable, make Fluttershy feel comfortable, comfortable, comfortable... Well, I mean, that shouldn't be a problem.",Friendship & Relationships,
34,Discord,Discordant Harmony,Oops! [laughs] I forgot that I still had this on!,Identity & Personal Growth,
35,Discord,Discordant Harmony,Because you and I don't make sense to anypony else.,Identity & Personal Growth,
36,Discord,Discordant Harmony,Of course! I should get her the best of everything. Why didn't I think of that? ...Well? Are you going to answer me or not?,Identity & Personal Growth,
37,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Now, let's see. I have the perfect tea and the perfect tea service. What else do I need for the perfect tea party? Oh! Decorations, of course!",Food & Drink,
38,Discord,Discordant Harmony,A teapot that just pours tea? How positively dreadful!,Food & Drink,
39,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Yes, you can. Your finest tea set, please. I want only the best for my friend Fluttershy.",Friendship & Relationships,
40,Discord,Discordant Harmony,What particularly nice weather we're having.,Nature & Animals,

43,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Well, I can just pop us in some more.",Food & Drink,
44,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Why, thank you for noticing. I also couldn't help but notice that you need a refill.",Food & Drink,
45,Discord,Discordant Harmony,Maybe it's not as bad as I think. Maybe Fluttershy would be comfortable having a tea party here.,Food & Drink,
46,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Okay. Since Fluttershy always goes out of her way to host the perfect tea party for me, how do I make my tea party for her even more perfect?",Friendship & Relationships,
47,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Me, too! I'm so excited! I can't wait! No, really, I can't! How about we have the tea party tomorrow afternoon?",Identity & Personal Growth,
48,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Well, whatever do you mean? This is just me being me.",Identity & Personal Growth,
49,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"[chuckling] Well! In that case, I certainly don't need to be wearing this.",Identity & Personal Growth,
50,Discord,Discordant Harmony,Oh! You remembered to cut off the crusts for me.,Food & Drink,
51,Discord,Discordant Harmony,I think you'll be quite pleased with the green tea I've selected for us today.,Food & Drink,
52,Discord,Discordant Harmony,Oh. I never realized how much work you put into hosting these tea parties.,Identity & Personal Growth,
53,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Got it! We know Fluttershy, and we know what she likes. First of all, we need to get rid of all the new stuff.",Friendship & Relationships,
54,Discord,Discordant Harmony,Excuse me. Is this where Fluttershy usually buys her tea?,Food & Drink,
55,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Uh, well, it tastes delicious.",Food & Drink,
56,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"No, no, no, no, no! I've been taking advantage of your hospitality for far too long. It's high time I do something about it. What to do, what to do...",Identity & Personal Growth,
57,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Yes... judgy... clerk... pony! Why is it such a surprise? Sure, she's on the quieter side, and I'm a bit, well, more showy. But I'll have you know we're besties. And that's why I need the [echoing] best tea set!",Friendship & Relationships,
58,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"I know. I was afraid that if you saw exactly how different we are, you wouldn't want to be friends anymore.",Identity & Personal Growth,
59,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Well, that's okay, because I've never hosted a tea party before.",Identity & Personal Growth,
60,Discord,Discordant Harmony,And I'm almost certain she likes stairs...,Friendship & Relationships,
61,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Actually, madam, I'm talking to myself.",Identity & Personal Growth,
62,Discord,Discordant Harmony,Maybe I just need another set of eyes on this. What do you think?,Identity & Personal Growth,
63,Discord,Discordant Harmony,Can I trouble you for another sugarcube?,Food & Drink,
64,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Oh, wonderful! I'll be enjoying her company tomorrow, so I will be needing your very best tea, please. Something especially special.",Friendship & Relationships,

74,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"Well, I suppose I could squeeze you in if I move a few very important ponies around.",Authority & Leadership,
75,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"[reverberating] You find yourself on the battlefield. A barrage of arrows rains down on you. If you roll a fifteen or higher, the shield protects you. Fourteen or lower and, well... [laughs] You get the idea.",Authority & Leadership,
76,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"[snorts] Can I suggest we take a break and, I don't know, go out and have some fun? Ponyville's not going to paint itself red.",Authority & Leadership,

81,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"[gravelly accent] June, honey, be a dear. Reschedule Luna and Cay-Cay. [normal, aside] That's what I call Princess Celestia, what a hoot!

85,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,Games? I love games. I'm great at games.,Identity & Personal Growth,
86,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"[gasps] Well, it's not my fault the new train route leads into an active volcano. Guess you'll have to stay.",Nature & Animals,

88,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"If I'm the worst, then why did you invite me?",Identity & Personal Growth,
89,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"I already have the best name in the universe. Why would I change it for something like ""Captain Wuzz""?",Identity & Personal Growth,
90,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"That does sound fun, actually...",Identity & Personal Growth,
91,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,[scoffs] Consider it considered.,Authority & Leadership,
92,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,[gasps] So what you're saying is no tea? Ugh. Well. [clears throat] That's fine. I wasn't thirsty anyway.,Food & Drink,
93,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,[clears throat] [mumbling] I'm listening.,Authority & Leadership,
94,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,This can't be. I'm supposed to feel sorry for you because I'm me and you're you.,Friendship & Relationships,
95,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"Oh, this game is insufferable! Let me show you a real guys' night!",Authority & Leadership,
96,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"So, shall we hop to it? I made a list of the rowdiest establishments in Ponyville. It's rather short.",Authority & Leadership,
97,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"Oh, Twilight's friend and Applejack's monosyllabic brother, if only I weren't super busy this evening.",Friendship & Relationships,
98,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"Technically, the fun starts when I arrive, but I'll make sure it's around sunset. Adieu, fellas.",Identity & Personal Growth,
99,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"I'm trying to say I'm sorry, all right?! I'm sorry for ruining your game, and I'm sorry that I thought I was better than you! [pants] [quickly] Now let's play before this evening gets any sappier, shall we?",Identity & Personal Growth,
100,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,Isn't this what every gamer wants? To live the game? Like this?!,Identity & Personal Growth,
101,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"Oh, how kind of you to notice. It's the little details that really bring alternate dimensions to life, wouldn't you say?",Nature & Animals,
102,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,Sounds just as miserable as the other options. So fine.,Identity & Personal Growth,
103,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"[laughing] This is the life! Jazz, dancing, the best table magic can buy! This is what guys' night is all about. Am I right, fellas?","History, Lore, & Magic",
104,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,I stick my head through the bars and demand for the immediate release of the Lord of Chaos.,Authority & Leadership,

107,Discord,Keep Calm and Flutter On,"Oh. Well, it does, very much so. You're so very kind, my dear Fluttershy. I always knew that you were the understanding one, not like those nasty friends of yours.",Friendship & Relationships,
108,Discord,Keep Calm and Flutter On,Oh... [sniggers] He's adorable the way he is.,Friendship & Relationships,
109,Discord,Keep Calm and Flutter On,"Oh, well, I don't know about that. Mistakes happen. Oh, look, everypony, dancing candles!","History, Lore, & Magic",
110,Discord,Keep Calm and Flutter On,Now why in the world would I ever try to do a thing like that?,Identity & Personal Growth,
111,Discord,Keep Calm and Flutter On,"Oh, our pony guests! [upper class voice] We're so delighted that you've come. Please, do come in.",Friendship & Relationships,
112,Discord,Keep Calm and Flutter On,"Buh-bye, have a nice time! Everything is fine here. Bye bye... Bye bye...",Friendship & Relationships,
113,Discord,Keep Calm and Flutter On,I ask that you never use your Element of Harmony against me. As a sign of our friendship.,"History, Lore, & Magic",
114,Discord,Keep Calm and Flutter On,Wh-what?! Look at me! I'm practically reformed already.,Identity & Personal Growth,
115,Discord,Keep Calm and Flutter On,"Where are you going? What's wrong, pal?",Friendship & Relationships,
116,Discord,Keep Calm and Flutter On,"Oh, yes, very well, I will fix it. I only ask one thing in return.",Authority & Leadership,
117,Discord,Keep Calm and Flutter On,"Hey there, Fluttershy, you want a turn? The water's great!",Nature & Animals,
118,Discord,Keep Calm and Flutter On,"No, I think you just made them mad.",Identity & Personal Growth,
119,Discord,Keep Calm and Flutter On,Being turned to stone doesn't keep me from hearing every word Celestia says. Although I admit it makes rolling my eyes a challenge.,Identity & Personal Growth,
120,Discord,Keep Calm and Flutter On,"[blows raspberry] You know what else is adorable? You ponies truly believe that you can reform me, and that you're putting your faith in this one here to make it happen. Makes me wanna pinch your little horsey cheeks...",Identity & Personal Growth,
121,Discord,Keep Calm and Flutter On,"Oh, you wouldn't dare turn me back to stone and risk disappointing your precious princess.",Identity & Personal Growth,
122,Discord,Keep Calm and Flutter On,"[eating] Are you sure this isn't overdoing it? You said to make myself at home while you were gone, but I wouldn't want to overstep my bounds.",Identity & Personal Growth,
123,Discord,Keep Calm and Flutter On,"I like it better my way, but... I guess when you're friends, you can't always have things exactly your way all the time, eh?",Friendship & Relationships,
124,Discord,Keep Calm and Flutter On,Whoops! [chuckles] I'm so sorry!,Identity & Personal Growth,
125,Discord,Keep Calm and Flutter On,"Oh, yes. Awful business, that. Mm.",Identity & Personal Growth,

127,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,"You're supposed to say ""Who's there?""! This is the most basic of jokes!",Identity & Personal Growth,
128,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,"Now, listen, Smooze. I need to make this a party of one for a little while. Just stay out here until I come for you.",Authority & Leadership,
129,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,"I've only got these tiny mismatched wings, and even I can fly better than Twilight Sparkle! Am I right? Pchoo!","History, Lore, & Magic",
130,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,"Yes, because that's what you did!",Identity & Personal Growth,

133,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,"[laughs nervously] Uh, well, perhaps you're into more observational humor.",Identity & Personal Growth,
134,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,"Fluttershy, tell the Hugs here about the time that we went to the store and came back with two cakes instead of one, because that's how crazy we are when we're together.",Identity & Personal Growth,
135,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,"Oh. Well, you kind of left out all the fun and frivolity there. But I'm sure you got it, Tree Hugger.",Nature & Animals,
136,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,"Yes, yes, yes, I believe I got that!",Identity & Personal Growth,
137,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,We like each other. That was the point! I'm actually pretty lukewarm about cake.,Food & Drink,

139,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,"Uh... [stuttering] No, I suppose not. It would just mean that I'd have different friends for different things... Oh, oh, dear, it looks like I've perhaps overreacted just a skosh.",Identity & Personal Growth,
140,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,"Isn't it, though? And to think, it would never have happened had I come to the Gala as somepony else's plus-one.",Identity & Personal Growth,
141,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,We should all go out to dinner sometime?! Have you no heart?,Identity & Personal Growth,
142,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Do you even know what you just said?,Identity & Personal Growth,
143,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,"""No, no, here. Take my plus-one. I insist. Before somepony else thinks he's my friend and expects to be asked instead. What's that? You're worried Discord might be upset?"" Not a problem! I can make more new friends anytime I want. It's not as if any of this actually mattered!

144,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,"Oh, your chakras. [laughs nervously] Fair enough.","History, Lore, & Magic",
145,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,"Well, I guess we're just going to have to exclude them from our party this time. Oh, did I say that out loud? I mean, ta-ta.",Identity & Personal Growth,
146,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,"Oh, please. I have better things to do than to watch that thing all night.

147,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,[to the Smooze] You are making me look like a fool in front of Fluttershy. I'll be back when the Gala is over.,Identity & Personal Growth,

152,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,"Good evening, everypony! What a glorious affair!",Friendship & Relationships,
153,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,"You? [laughs] Of course not! You think I don't have other friends? I'm centuries old! I was talking about the Smooze! Smooze Face, the Smoozinator <U+0096> well, I mean that's what we called him back in college. Smooze! I would like you to meet Fluttershy and, um, hmm... Tree... how'd you say it...

154,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,[grimly] Why is this so late?,Identity & Personal Growth,
155,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,You know what? Cancel my order.,Authority & Leadership,
156,Discord,Make New Friends but Keep Discord,"I'm doing her a favor, Fluttershy! It's a lovely dimension! White sand beaches, attentive wait staff... I mean, okay, the humidity isn't great, but where isn't that the case these days?",Nature & Animals,

162,Discord,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Why don't you ask your zebra friend if she knows anything?,Friendship & Relationships,
163,Discord,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,"Well then, it seems we've reached an impasse. I'm telling the truth, but you think I'm lying. What do friends like us do in a situation like this, Princess Twilight? Congrats, by the way, on the promotion. You totally deserve it.",Friendship & Relationships,
164,Discord,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,"Why, [chuckles] whatever are you talking about?",Identity & Personal Growth,

In case you haven't noticed, I was in the middle of a particularly invigorating shower.","History, Lore, & Magic",
168,Discord,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,"I for one found it delightful. Sort of a one-pony theater piece, if you will. You should really consider taking it on the road.",Identity & Personal Growth,
169,Discord,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,And rob you of a valuable lesson about being princess? What kind of friend do you think I am?,Friendship & Relationships,
170,Discord,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,"Oh, I do hope she breaks into a song this time!",Friendship & Relationships,
171,Discord,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,I'm just surprised that you agreed to their plan. I never thought you'd be the kind of pony who would think she was better than everypony else.,Identity & Personal Growth,

173,Discord,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,"Oh, I doubt that. [munching] Hungry? [voice over] Well, obviously things didn't go according to my original plan. My plunderseeds should have stolen the magic from the Tree of Harmony and captured Princess Celestia and Princess Luna thousands of moons ago. Alas, it seems the tree had enough magic to keep the seeds from growing up big and strong. Until now, that is.","History, Lore, & Magic",
174,Discord,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,I'm reformed. Don't you remember? Why don't you ask your zebra friend?,Identity & Personal Growth,
