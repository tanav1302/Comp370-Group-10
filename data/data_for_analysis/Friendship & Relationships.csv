162,Discord,Why don't you ask your zebra friend if she knows anything?,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1
163,Discord,"Well then, it seems we've reached an impasse. I'm telling the truth, but you think I'm lying. What do friends like us do in a situation like this, Princess Twilight? Congrats, by the way, on the promotion. You totally deserve it.",Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1
169,Discord,And rob you of a valuable lesson about being princess? What kind of friend do you think I am?,Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2

236,Discord,"But taking in the sick and the desperate - isn't that what Fluttershy would do? Isn't 'helping' something that friends do for friends? Unless, of course, you're really saying that you're not my friend.",Three's A Crowd
