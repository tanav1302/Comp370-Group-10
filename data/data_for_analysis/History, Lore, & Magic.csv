242,Discord,"Well, she told me about it in her last letter.",Three's A Crowd
246,Discord,"You know whenever ponies talk about powerful magic, they always leave me out. If I weren't so evolved, I might decide to take it personally. Well, isn't this quite the combination of secondary characters? Where are Twilight and the girls?",To Where and Back Again - Part 1

12,Princess Celestia,"A phoenix is a majestic and magical bird. While it appears healthy and happy most of the time, every so often it must renew itself by shedding all of its feathers and bursting into flame. [silently] Rather melodramatic, if you ask me.

69,Princess Celestia,"Uh, this is Twilight's fantasy, Spike. There is no wrong way to fantasize.",Celestial Advice
75,Princess Celestia,"This seems like a lovely path for Starlight. The changelings have so much to learn about how to enjoy love through friendships. Starlight would be busy for a very long time, but her work there would be very rewarding.",Celestial Advice

237,Princess Celestia,"He was ultimately overthrown, turned to shadow, and banished to the ice of the arctic north.",The Crystal Empire - Part 1
239,Princess Celestia,"There wouldn't be. Few remember it ever existed at all. Even my knowledge of the Empire is limited. But what I do know is that it contains a powerful magic.

240,Princess Celestia,"But not before he was able to put a curse upon the Empire. A curse that caused it to vanish into thin air.

270,Princess Celestia,Enough! What have you done with the Elements of Harmony?,The Return of Harmony Part 1
