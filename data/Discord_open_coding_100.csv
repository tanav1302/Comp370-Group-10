1,Discord,A Matter of Principals,Really? I thought there must be some mistake.,,
2,Discord,A Matter of Principals,"[through mock tears] I hate goodbyes, don't you? I just go to pieces.",,
3,Discord,A Matter of Principals,"Why, I'm a student of friendship, of course. Unless you don't think you're good enough to teach me.",,
4,Discord,A Matter of Principals,"Fine! From now on, I won't try to help. At! All!",,
5,Discord,A Matter of Principals,"To fill in for Twilight, of course, as head-draconequus. I seem to recall a whole song about how this school is where you make your own rules. Now, who better at that than me?",,
6,Discord,A Matter of Principals,"My problem? How is the fact that Twilight decided to put an incompetent, power-hungry unicorn in charge of her school my problem?!",,
7,Discord,A Matter of Principals,Oh! Some thanks for all my help. And after I hired all those substitute teachers for you.,,
8,Discord,A Matter of Principals,Uh... [stuttering] I don't know what you're getting at.,,
9,Discord,A Matter of Principals,"Oh, I better take this. Hello?",,
10,Discord,A Matter of Principals,"[writing] ""Item one <U+0096> Gravity is optional.""",,
11,Discord,A Matter of Principals,"""Item two <U+0096> The school's new mascot is an ambidextrous marmoset.""",,
12,Discord,A Matter of Principals,"I accept! I mean, I-I-I suppose I can find some time in my busy schedule to help you out. But I will need my own office, expense account, parking space...",,
13,Discord,A Matter of Principals,"Oh, he did not! And what did you say?",,
14,Discord,A Matter of Principals,But then we'd miss out on all those delightful misadventures.,,
15,Discord,A Matter of Principals,"[chuckles] Well, with a few surprises.",,
16,Discord,Celestial Advice,"Or we could go cause a little mischief. I know a trick that'll turn Celestia's castle into cheese. Do you think it's a ""gouda"" idea? [laughs] That's just the first of many cheese jokes if we go down this path.",,
17,Discord,Celestial Advice,"You already planned the perfect moment during the party to make the grand announcement to everypony about your plan. Brava, Twilight! I can't wait to tell your plan to Fluttershy and the others!",,
18,Discord,Celestial Advice,"No, no. Clearly, Starlight is beyond basic friendship lessons. She just won a medal, for Equestria's sake. I thought you were joking. You are joking, right?",,
19,Discord,Celestial Advice,"You weren't coming up with a plan just now, were you? Oh, dear. This could be pretty embarrassing for you.",,
20,Discord,Celestial Advice,Psst! I see what you're doing.,,
21,Discord,Celestial Advice,"Probably because you're not as close as you think you are. [laughs] Just kidding. She wanted it to be a big surprise. Just between us, she's getting ready to make a big announcement!",,
22,Discord,Celestial Advice,Darn it. I was hoping you would send her to my realm. We could've been roomies. Way to not pick up what I was putting down.,,
23,Discord,Celestial Advice,"Oh, Starlight. Princess Twilight has something very important to tell us. Well, just you, really, but I'm nosy and I want to hear.",,
24,Discord,Celestial Advice,"Yes, Starlight is student of the year, isn't she? She has so much potential. So, what are we going to do with her? And by ""we"", I definitely mean ""you"". Being her mentor and all that, her destiny falls squarely on your haunches.",,
25,Discord,Celestial Advice,"Yes, because you did it all by yourself.",,
26,Discord,Celestial Advice,Anytime. I really do love being helpful.,,
27,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"And that's why you're the party expert. Thank you, Pinkie Pie. I feel so much better now.",,
28,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"[sips tea] It did rain the other day, however.",,
29,Discord,Discordant Harmony,How boring. Pass. Hold on! Ginseng tea! Now that sounds promising. What does it sing? I'm partial to something upbeat and jazzy.,,
30,Discord,Discordant Harmony,Do something chaotic? I'll try...,,
31,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Okay, let's give these conversation cards a whirl. [clears throat, reading] ""It is very nice to see you today."" ""Have you read any good books lately?"" ""Your garden looks positively lovely.""",,
32,Discord,Discordant Harmony,This is what you were hoping for? But this is the complete opposite of your tea parties.,,
33,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Make Fluttershy feel comfortable, make Fluttershy feel comfortable, comfortable, comfortable... Well, I mean, that shouldn't be a problem.",,
34,Discord,Discordant Harmony,Oops! [laughs] I forgot that I still had this on!,,
35,Discord,Discordant Harmony,Because you and I don't make sense to anypony else.,,
36,Discord,Discordant Harmony,Of course! I should get her the best of everything. Why didn't I think of that? ...Well? Are you going to answer me or not?,,
37,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Now, let's see. I have the perfect tea and the perfect tea service. What else do I need for the perfect tea party? Oh! Decorations, of course!",,
38,Discord,Discordant Harmony,A teapot that just pours tea? How positively dreadful!,,
39,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Yes, you can. Your finest tea set, please. I want only the best for my friend Fluttershy.",,
40,Discord,Discordant Harmony,What particularly nice weather we're having.,,
41,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"There you go. Back to normal, just the way you like it. See you tomorrow!",,
42,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Oh, dear. That might be a problem.",,
43,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Well, I can just pop us in some more.",,
44,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Why, thank you for noticing. I also couldn't help but notice that you need a refill.",,
45,Discord,Discordant Harmony,Maybe it's not as bad as I think. Maybe Fluttershy would be comfortable having a tea party here.,,
46,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Okay. Since Fluttershy always goes out of her way to host the perfect tea party for me, how do I make my tea party for her even more perfect?",,
47,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Me, too! I'm so excited! I can't wait! No, really, I can't! How about we have the tea party tomorrow afternoon?",,
48,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Well, whatever do you mean? This is just me being me.",,
49,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"[chuckling] Well! In that case, I certainly don't need to be wearing this.",,
50,Discord,Discordant Harmony,Oh! You remembered to cut off the crusts for me.,,
51,Discord,Discordant Harmony,I think you'll be quite pleased with the green tea I've selected for us today.,,
52,Discord,Discordant Harmony,Oh. I never realized how much work you put into hosting these tea parties.,,
53,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Got it! We know Fluttershy, and we know what she likes. First of all, we need to get rid of all the new stuff.",,
54,Discord,Discordant Harmony,Excuse me. Is this where Fluttershy usually buys her tea?,,
55,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Uh, well, it tastes delicious.",,
56,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"No, no, no, no, no! I've been taking advantage of your hospitality for far too long. It's high time I do something about it. What to do, what to do...",,
57,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Yes... judgy... clerk... pony! Why is it such a surprise? Sure, she's on the quieter side, and I'm a bit, well, more showy. But I'll have you know we're besties. And that's why I need the [echoing] best tea set!",,
58,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"I know. I was afraid that if you saw exactly how different we are, you wouldn't want to be friends anymore.",,
59,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Well, that's okay, because I've never hosted a tea party before.",,
60,Discord,Discordant Harmony,And I'm almost certain she likes stairs...,,
61,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Actually, madam, I'm talking to myself.",,
62,Discord,Discordant Harmony,Maybe I just need another set of eyes on this. What do you think?,,
63,Discord,Discordant Harmony,Can I trouble you for another sugarcube?,,
64,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Oh, wonderful! I'll be enjoying her company tomorrow, so I will be needing your very best tea, please. Something especially special.",,
65,Discord,Discordant Harmony,"Oh, dear Fluttershy, worry not. I can assure you that for the first time, I'm feeling perfectly normal. Now, let me top you off.",,
66,Discord,Discordant Harmony,It really is nice having you here.,,
67,Discord,Discordant Harmony,Enjoy your all-expense-paid trip around Equestria!,,
68,Discord,Discordant Harmony,Oops! Butterfingers! How embarrassing.,,
69,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,Sit and watch? Fine. We'll play your game. [reverberating] Are you ready to enter the world of Ogres & Oubliettes?,,
70,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"[to himself] Oh, here we go...",,
71,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,I seal Sir McBiggun in a magic bubble until he stops laughing!,,
72,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"Oh, please. Don't stoop to tedious reverse psychology. You're better than that.",,
73,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"Uh... [stammering] No, no, actually, that's not what I meant to say... I'm... sssssss...",,
74,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"Well, I suppose I could squeeze you in if I move a few very important ponies around.",,
75,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"[reverberating] You find yourself on the battlefield. A barrage of arrows rains down on you. If you roll a fifteen or higher, the shield protects you. Fourteen or lower and, well... [laughs] You get the idea.",,
76,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"[snorts] Can I suggest we take a break and, I don't know, go out and have some fun? Ponyville's not going to paint itself red.",,
77,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"Curse myself for attending this infernal evening? Ohhh, no, you mean in the game.",,
78,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,[reverberating] [laughs] Aren't games fun?,,
79,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"I ruined your night, and you don't even think I'm cool? Ugh. [zap] [muffled] How embarrassing. I should go. [normal] I have a lot of other friends I need to see tonight.",,
80,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"Oh, you mean like trapping best friend ponies in hedge mazes and turning them against each other. Those were the days.",,
81,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"[gravelly accent] June, honey, be a dear. Reschedule Luna and Cay-Cay. [normal, aside] That's what I call Princess Celestia, what a hoot! [gravelly accent] In fact, clear the whole evening. Tonight is guys' night. These fellas invited me to spice things up and bring a little class to the whole affair.",,
82,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,I'm not intelligent? I cast it anyway because this game is stupid.,,
83,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,Couldn't I just come with you instead?,,
84,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,This spell here. I transform him into a parsnip.,,
85,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,Games? I love games. I'm great at games.,,
86,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"[gasps] Well, it's not my fault the new train route leads into an active volcano. Guess you'll have to stay.",,
87,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"Don't you laugh at me, Big Mac! Does it really say that? Let me see.",,
88,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"If I'm the worst, then why did you invite me?",,
89,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"I already have the best name in the universe. Why would I change it for something like ""Captain Wuzz""?",,
90,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"That does sound fun, actually...",,
91,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,[scoffs] Consider it considered.,,
92,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,[gasps] So what you're saying is no tea? Ugh. Well. [clears throat] That's fine. I wasn't thirsty anyway.,,
93,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,[clears throat] [mumbling] I'm listening.,,
94,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,This can't be. I'm supposed to feel sorry for you because I'm me and you're you.,,
95,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"Oh, this game is insufferable! Let me show you a real guys' night!",,
96,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"So, shall we hop to it? I made a list of the rowdiest establishments in Ponyville. It's rather short.",,
97,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"Oh, Twilight's friend and Applejack's monosyllabic brother, if only I weren't super busy this evening.",,
98,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"Technically, the fun starts when I arrive, but I'll make sure it's around sunset. Adieu, fellas.",,
99,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,"I'm trying to say I'm sorry, all right?! I'm sorry for ruining your game, and I'm sorry that I thought I was better than you! [pants] [quickly] Now let's play before this evening gets any sappier, shall we?",,
100,Discord,Dungeons & Discords,Isn't this what every gamer wants? To live the game? Like this?!,,
