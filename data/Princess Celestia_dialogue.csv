"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Princess Celestia,"Spike, take a note, please. I, Princess Celestia, hereby decree that the unicorn Twilight Sparkle shall take on a new mission for Equestria. She must continue to study the magic of friendship. She must report to me her findings from her new home in Ponyville."
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Princess Celestia,"I told you that you needed to make some friends, nothing more. I saw the signs of Nightmare Moon's return, and I knew it was you who had the magic inside to defeat her, but you could not unleash it until you let true friendship into your heart. Now if only another will as well. Princess Luna!"
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Princess Celestia,"Why so glum, my faithful student? Are you not happy that your quest is complete and you can return to your studies in Canterlot?"
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Princess Celestia,"Twilight Sparkle, my faithful student. I knew you could do it."
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Princess Celestia,"I've missed you, too."
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Princess Celestia,Indeed you do.
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Princess Celestia,"It has been a thousand years since I have seen you like this. Time to put our differences behind us. We were meant to rule together, little sister."
"Friendship is Magic, part 2",Princess Celestia,Will you accept my friendship?
Griffon the Brush Off,Princess Celestia,"Dear Twilight Sparkle,"
Swarm of the Century,Princess Celestia,I'm terribly honored that you and the good citizens of Ponyville have organized a parade in honor of my visit.
Swarm of the Century,Princess Celestia,"Twilight Sparkle, my prized pupil."
Swarm of the Century,Princess Celestia,"Yes, a swarm of incredibly bothersome creatures has invaded the poor town. I'm sorry Twilight, to have to put you all through so much trouble."
Swarm of the Century,Princess Celestia,"Unfortunately, that visit is going to have to wait for another time. I'm afraid an emergency has come up in Fillydelphia. Apparently there's been some sort of infestation."
Swarm of the Century,Princess Celestia,"I'm so proud of you, Twilight Sparkle, and I'm very impressed with your friends as well. It sounds like you're all learning so much from each other."
Swarm of the Century,Princess Celestia,Haven't you learned anything about friendship?
Swarm of the Century,Princess Celestia,"So lovely to see you again, as well as your friends."
Swarm of the Century,Princess Celestia,"Before I have to go, would you care to give me your latest report on the magic of friendship in person?"
Swarm of the Century,Princess Celestia,"Ah, what is this? Oh ho ho, these creatures are adorable."
Call of the Cutie,Princess Celestia,...can actually be the thing that helps you make your closest friends and realize how special you are. Hmm...
Fall Weather Friends,Princess Celestia,"That's all right, Applejack. Anypony can get swept up in the excitement of competition."
Fall Weather Friends,Princess Celestia,"Exactly, Twilight. Now, unfortunately, because the two of you were busy tricking each other instead of shaking down leaves, many of the lovely trees of Equestria are still covered."
Fall Weather Friends,Princess Celestia,Sounds to me that an important lesson was learned.
Fall Weather Friends,Princess Celestia,"Fall is one of my favorite seasons, so I came to celebrate the Running of the Leaves."
Sonic Rainboom,Princess Celestia,"Excellent. Well done, Rarity."
Sonic Rainboom,Princess Celestia,"So Twilight Sparkle, did you learn anything about friendship from this experience?"
Sonic Rainboom,Princess Celestia,"Hello, Twilight Sparkle, and hello to your friends too."
Sonic Rainboom,Princess Celestia,"I know she is, my dear. That's why, for her incredible act of bravery and her spectacular sonic rainboom, I'm presenting the grand prize for Best Young Flyer to this year's winner, Miss Rainbow Dash!"
A Bird in the Hoof,Princess Celestia,[sips] Thank you again.
A Bird in the Hoof,Princess Celestia,"As do I. As Princess, I care deeply about all creatures, great and small."
A Bird in the Hoof,Princess Celestia,"Of course not, my little pony. Where on Earth would you get such an idea?"
A Bird in the Hoof,Princess Celestia,[sips] [sips] [sips] Gotcha!
A Bird in the Hoof,Princess Celestia,"Really? Well, if I must... I'm sorry, everypony. I'm afraid I have to cut the party short. The mayor has requested an audience with me. Royal duty calls. Thank you for a wonderful time. It's been a joy getting to know you all better."
A Bird in the Hoof,Princess Celestia,"She is quite a sight, isn't she?"
A Bird in the Hoof,Princess Celestia,"No, that's quite all right. I think I can remember."
A Bird in the Hoof,Princess Celestia,"Ah, Philomena, my pet. You're awake. Do say hello to our gracious hosts."
A Bird in the Hoof,Princess Celestia,"Everything is fine, Mr. and Mrs. Cake."
A Bird in the Hoof,Princess Celestia,I understand from Twilight Sparkle's letters that you enjoy tending to the needs of woodland creatures.
A Bird in the Hoof,Princess Celestia,What is going on here? Twilight?
A Bird in the Hoof,Princess Celestia,"A phoenix is a majestic and magical bird. While it appears healthy and happy most of the time, every so often it must renew itself by shedding all of its feathers and bursting into flame. [silently] Rather melodramatic, if you ask me. [loud again] It then rises from the ashes, fresh as a daisy. All just a normal part of the life cycle of a phoenix. I'm afraid mischievous little Philomena here took the occasion to have a little fun with you, Fluttershy. Say you're sorry, young lady."
A Bird in the Hoof,Princess Celestia,"And I do appreciate that your heart was in the right place, child. But all you had to do was ask me and I could have told you Philomena was a phoenix and saved you all this trouble."
A Bird in the Hoof,Princess Celestia,"This is Philomena. She's quite a sight, as I said. But nothing unusual for a phoenix. Isn't that right, Philomena?"
A Bird in the Hoof,Princess Celestia,Nothing means more to me than the well-being of all my subjects.
A Bird in the Hoof,Princess Celestia,"Oh, stop fooling around, Philomena. You're scaring everypony."
A Bird in the Hoof,Princess Celestia,"Oh, um... thank you."
A Bird in the Hoof,Princess Celestia,"And what about you, dear? Fluttershy, is it?"
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,Princess Celestia,"Twilight Sparkle, I'd like to make you my own personal prot<e9>g<e9> here at the school."
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,Princess Celestia,But you need to learn to tame these abilities through focused study.
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,Princess Celestia,You have a very special gift. I don't think I've ever come across a unicorn with your raw abilities.
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,Princess Celestia,Twilight Sparkle.
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,Princess Celestia,Well?
The Cutie Mark Chronicles,Princess Celestia,"One other thing, Twilight."
The Best Night Ever,Princess Celestia,"Oh, Twilight. The Grand Galloping Gala is always awful."
The Best Night Ever,Princess Celestia,"Yes. Me too, Twi... Oh, good evening! Welcome to the Gala. Which is why I... Ladies! Lovely to see you again."
The Best Night Ever,Princess Celestia,That was the best Grand Galloping Gala ever!
The Best Night Ever,Princess Celestia,[in background] Good evening! So nice to see you. Welcome!
The Best Night Ever,Princess Celestia,"That is why I was thrilled you were all attending. I was hoping you could liven things up a bit. And while the evening may not have gone as you planned, I'm sure you'll agree that in the end it didn't turn out so bad for this group of friends."
The Best Night Ever,Princess Celestia,Twilight! It is so lovely to see my star student.
The Best Night Ever,Princess Celestia,"Well, I want you right by my side the entire evening, so we'll have plenty of time together."
The Best Night Ever,Princess Celestia,Welcome to the Grand Galloping Gala.
The Best Night Ever,Princess Celestia,Run.
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Princess Celestia,Enough! What have you done with the Elements of Harmony?
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Princess Celestia,"You six showed the full potential of the Elements by harnessing the magic of your friendship to beat a mighty foe. Although Luna and I once wielded the Elements, it is you who now control their power, and it is you who must defeat Discord!"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Princess Celestia,"Have no fear, ponies. I have total confidence that you will be able to defeat Discord with these!"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Princess Celestia,"Stop stalling, Discord! What have you done with the Elements of Harmony?"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Princess Celestia,"This is Canterlot Tower, where the Elements are kept inside since all of you recovered them. I need you to wield the Elements of Harmony once again and stop Discord before he thrusts all of Equestria into eternal chaos."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Princess Celestia,"Thank you, Twilight. Thank you, all."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Princess Celestia,Follow me.
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Princess Celestia,"I thought the spell we cast would keep him contained forever, but since Luna and I are no longer connected to the Elements, the spell has been broken."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Princess Celestia,"I've called you here for a matter of great importance. It seems an old foe of mine, someone I thought I had defeated long ago, has returned. His name... is Discord."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Princess Celestia,Discord... Show yourself!
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Princess Celestia,"Discord is the mischievous spirit of disharmony. Before my sister and I stood up to him, he ruled Equestria in an eternal state of unrest and unhappiness. Luna and I saw how miserable life was for Earth ponies, Pegasi, and unicorns alike, so after discovering the Elements of Harmony, we combined our powers and rose up against him, turning him to stone."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Princess Celestia,That chamber is protected by a powerful spell that only I can break! This doesn't make sense!
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Princess Celestia,"Good luck, my little ponies. The fate of Equestria is in your hooves."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Princess Celestia,"You'll never get away with this, Discord!"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Princess Celestia,We are gathered here today to once again honor the heroism of these six friends who stood up to the villain Discord and saved Equestria from eternal chaos.
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Princess Celestia,I need you to wield the Elements of Harmony once again and stop Discord.
Lesson Zero,Princess Celestia,I'm listening.
Lesson Zero,Princess Celestia,"You are a wonderful student, Twilight. I don't have to get a letter every week to know that."
Lesson Zero,Princess Celestia,"Very well. I'll forget Twilight's ""punishment"" on one condition."
Lesson Zero,Princess Celestia,"From this day forth, I would like you all to report to me your findings on the magic of friendship when, and only when, you happen to discover them."
Lesson Zero,Princess Celestia,Looks like you all learned a pretty valuable lesson today.
Lesson Zero,Princess Celestia,"Your friend Spike made me aware that you were letting your fears get the best of you. I commend him for taking your feelings seriously. Now, if you will all excuse me, I must return to Canterlot. I'm expecting some mail."
Lesson Zero,Princess Celestia,Twilight Sparkle!
Lesson Zero,Princess Celestia,Meet me in the library.
Sweet and Elite,Princess Celestia,You are very we<U+0096>
Sweet and Elite,Princess Celestia,Now that I would like to hear.
Sweet and Elite,Princess Celestia,Enjoy your stay.
Sweet and Elite,Princess Celestia,You're very welcome.
Sweet and Elite,Princess Celestia,I'll leave you to get settled.
Sweet and Elite,Princess Celestia,"It's nothing, really."
Sweet and Elite,Princess Celestia,"Hm, a very valuable lesson to have learned."
Sweet and Elite,Princess Celestia,"Twilight Sparkle said you were coming to Canterlot for a visit, and asked if I might accommodate you."
It's About Time,Princess Celestia,"Good morning, Twilight. Love the new hairstyle. Well, happy Tuesday!"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Princess Celestia,"Perfect, girls. No need to rush. Then of course, Cadance will enter."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Princess Celestia,"I'll say a few words, and then we'll begin with the vows. Shining Armor, you'll get the ring from your best mare."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1,Princess Celestia,You have a lot to think about.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Princess Celestia,"Mares and gentlecolts, we are gathered here today to witness the union of [muffled] Princess Mi Amore Cadenza and Shining Armor."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Princess Celestia,"Hm. The union of Princess Cadance and Shining Armor. The strength of their commitment is clear. The power of their love, undeniable. May we have the rings please? I now pronounce you mare and colt!"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Princess Celestia,The Elements of Harmony. You must get to them and use their power to defeat the queen.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Princess Celestia,Don't worry about me. I'm fine. You have a real wedding to put together.
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Princess Celestia,"Princess Cadance and Shining Armor, it is my great pleasure to pronounce you<U+0096>"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Princess Celestia,"This is your victory as much as theirs. You persisted in the face of doubt, and your actions led to your being able to bring the real Princess Cadance back to us. Learning to trust your instincts is a valuable lesson to learn."
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Princess Celestia,"Mares and gentlecolts, we are gathered here today to celebrate the union of the real Princess Mi Amore Cadenza<U+0096>"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Princess Celestia,"No. You won't. You may have made it impossible for Shining Armor to perform his spell, but now that you have so foolishly revealed your true self, I can protect my subjects from you!"
A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2,Princess Celestia,"Rainbow Dash, that's your cue."
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Princess Celestia,"My dearest Twilight, you must come to Canterlot at once."
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Princess Celestia,Then go. There is no time to lose.
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Princess Celestia,"She will succeed at her task. And when she does, we'll know that she is that much closer to being ready."
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Princess Celestia,Yes. Princess Cadance and Shining Armor are already there. The others will be joining them soon.
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Princess Celestia,You won't.
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Princess Celestia,"He was ultimately overthrown, turned to shadow, and banished to the ice of the arctic north."
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Princess Celestia,"He is. And your Ponyville friends will join you there as well. I have every confidence you will succeed. And when you do, I'll know you are ready to move on to the next level of your studies."
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Princess Celestia,"There wouldn't be. Few remember it ever existed at all. Even my knowledge of the Empire is limited. But what I do know is that it contains a powerful magic. One thousand years ago, King Sombra, a unicorn whose heart was black as night, took over the Crystal Empire."
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Princess Celestia,"It is, as I said, a different kind of test. But one I'm certain you will pass."
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Princess Celestia,Yes?
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Princess Celestia,"Trust me, little sister."
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Princess Celestia,"You won't. But Twilight, in the end, it must be you and you alone who ultimately assists Princess Cadance and Shining Armor in doing what needs to be done to protect the Empire. Do you understand?"
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Princess Celestia,This is a different kind of test. The Crystal Empire has returned.
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Princess Celestia,By joining Princess Cadance and Shining Armor in the Crystal Empire.
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Princess Celestia,"But not before he was able to put a curse upon the Empire. A curse that caused it to vanish into thin air. If the Empire is filled with hope and love, those things are reflected across all of Equestria. If hatred and fear take hold... Which is why I need your help finding a way to protect it."
The Crystal Empire - Part 1,Princess Celestia,[gasp] Find Princess Cadance and Shining Armor.
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Princess Celestia,And now you must go.
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Princess Celestia,The Crystal Empire has returned.
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Princess Celestia,It's beautiful.
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Princess Celestia,"Doesn't matter to me. You failed the test, Twilight!"
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Princess Celestia,It must be you and you alone.
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Princess Celestia,What are you doing here?
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Princess Celestia,"Not only will you not move on to the next level of your studies, you won't continue your studies at all!"
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Princess Celestia,"Twilight, as I understand it, Spike brought Princess Cadance the Crystal Heart because you weren't sure how quickly you could find a way to escape the tower. You weren't willing to risk the future of the citizens of the Crystal Empire in an effort to guarantee your own. Far better that I have a student who understands the meaning of self-sacrifice than one who only looks out for her own best interests."
The Crystal Empire - Part 2,Princess Celestia,Didn't I?
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Princess Celestia,"No need, Spike. I have them right here, and I've cast a spell so Discord can't take them and hide them again. Now where is Fluttershy? I believe she may know best how to begin reforming Discord."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Princess Celestia,"Yes, I understand. But I have use for Discord's magic if it can be reformed to serve good instead of evil. This is why I've brought Discord here, because I believe that you are the ponies who can help him do just that."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Princess Celestia,Need I remind you that you are the ponies who turned him back into stone like this in the first place?
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Princess Celestia,"I do. Now, I must return to Canterlot for Equestria's royal summit. You may release Discord when ready."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Princess Celestia,"Congratulations on your success, ponies. I definitely sense a big change in Discord. [to Twilight] I'll leave the Elements of Harmony with you, Twilight. Just in case."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Princess Celestia,"I'm fully aware that the last time Discord was here, he created serious havoc."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Princess Celestia,"I realize that this is a tall order, but I wouldn't ask if I weren't confident you could get him to use magic obediently of his own free will."
Magical Mystery Cure,Princess Celestia,"We are gathered here today in celebration of a momentous occasion. My most faithful student, Twilight Sparkle, has done many extraordinary things since she's lived in Ponyville. She even helped reunite me with my sister, Princess Luna. But today, Twilight Sparkle did something extraordinary. She created new magic, proving without a doubt that she is ready to be crowned Equestria's newest princess. Fillies and gentlecolts, may I present for the very first time, Princess Twilight Sparkle!"
Magical Mystery Cure,Princess Celestia,"You've come such a long, long way And I've watched you from that very first day To see how you might grow To see what you might do To see what you've been through And all the ways you've made me proud of you"
Magical Mystery Cure,Princess Celestia,That's because she is a princess.
Magical Mystery Cure,Princess Celestia,"Not in the same way as before. I'll still be here to help and guide you, but we're all your students now, too. You are an inspiration to us all, Twilight."
Magical Mystery Cure,Princess Celestia,"[echoing] Congratulations, Twilight. I knew you could do it."
Magical Mystery Cure,Princess Celestia,"Say something, Princess."
Magical Mystery Cure,Princess Celestia,"You did something today that's never been done before. Something even a great unicorn like Star Swirl the Bearded was not able to do, because he did not understand friendship like you do. The lessons you've learned here in Ponyville have taught you well. You have proven that you're ready, Twilight."
Magical Mystery Cure,Princess Celestia,[giggles] There will be time for all of that later.
Magical Mystery Cure,Princess Celestia,"Since you've come to Ponyville, you've displayed the charity, compassion, devotion, integrity, optimism, and of course, the leadership of a true princess."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Princess Celestia,"For my subjects, it has always been a celebration of my defeat of Nightmare Moon. But for me... [sighs] It was just a terrible reminder that I'd had to banish my own sister."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Princess Celestia,"A letter from Ponyville, I presume?"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Princess Celestia,And I'm sure you won't.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Princess Celestia,"No need for that now, Princess Twilight."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Princess Celestia,[giggles] No need to apologize.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Princess Celestia,"You may no longer be my student, Princess Twilight, but I hope you know that I will always be here if you need me. Just as I hope that you will always be there when I need you."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Princess Celestia,"But now it has become a wonderful reminder of her transformation back into Princess Luna, and our happy reunion. I am so pleased that you will be playing a role in the festivities. I know it must have been difficult to see your friends return to Ponyville without you."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Princess Celestia,I must admit that it is wonderful to actually be looking forward to the Summer Sun Celebration.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Princess Celestia,I'll leave you to it.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Princess Celestia,"We have managed to discover the only means by which we can defeat Discord and free the citizens of Equestria. Even without these elements, the Tree of Harmony will possess a powerful magic. As long as that magic remains, it will continue to control and contain all that grows here."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Princess Celestia,"Citizens of Equestria, it is no longer with a heavy heart but with great joy that I raise the summer sun. For this celebration now represents not the defeat of Nightmare Moon, but the return of my sister, Princess Luna."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Princess Celestia,"[gasp] Play time is over for you, Discord."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Princess Celestia,"[voice over] Even without these elements, the Tree of Harmony will possess a powerful magic. As long as that magic remains, it will continue to control and contain all that grows here."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Princess Celestia,"Oh, dear sister. I am sorry, but you have given me no choice but to use these."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Princess Celestia,I do not know where they are. But I do know that it is a mystery you will not be solving alone.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Princess Celestia,"Luna, I will not fight you! You must lower the moon! It is your duty!"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Princess Celestia,"Play time is over for you, Discord!"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Princess Celestia,We know how difficult it must have been for you to give up the Elements. It took great courage to relinquish them.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Princess Celestia,The Elements of Harmony.
Castle Mane-ia,Princess Celestia,"[voice over] As you know, the ancient castle that I once shared with Princess Luna lies mostly in ruins, deep in the Everfree Forest. But if you look carefully, you may find a book that could prove helpful to your research, hidden somewhere in what's left of the castle library."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Princess Celestia,"No, Twilight. I'm afraid I must call in another to stop Tirek. Discord."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Princess Celestia,"There is no doubt that Tirek is after Alicorn magic. With Discord by his side, we will not be able to stop him from taking it."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Princess Celestia,I've just had the most terrible dream.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Princess Celestia,His time in Tartarus left him very weak. He has just now gained enough strength to use his dark powers.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Princess Celestia,I'm afraid I put too much trust in Discord and the effect that friendship would have upon him.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Princess Celestia,"[narrating] Tirek and his brother Scorpan came here from a distant land, intent on stealing Equestrian magic. But Scorpan soon came to appreciate the ways of Equestria, even befriending a young unicorn wizard."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Princess Celestia,Your destiny's uncertain And that's sometimes hard to take But it will become much clearer With every new choice you make
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Princess Celestia,But there is one solution. It is only by making this sacrifice that Equestria and the lands beyond it might be saved. We must rid ourselves of our magic before Tirek has the chance to steal it from us.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Princess Celestia,"Tirek has stolen enough magic that he now has the strength to steal flight as well. Without Pegasi to control the weather, there will be no rain in Equestria. There is word he has gone after Earth ponies as well. Without their strength, they will not be able to tend the land."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Princess Celestia,Your time will come.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Princess Celestia,"[narrating] Scorpan returned to his own land, and Tirek was sent to Tartarus for his crimes. But it appears he has found a way to escape."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Princess Celestia,"Then we haven't much time. The stronger he becomes, the more we are all in danger."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Princess Celestia,Having all four of us in the Empire to greet them lets the dignitaries know that their visit is considered an important one.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Princess Celestia,You are a princess; you'll play your part
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Princess Celestia,"We do not believe that Tirek is aware that a fourth Alicorn princess exists in Equestria. If we transfer our magic to you, Tirek will not know where it has gone."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Princess Celestia,I'm afraid I must call in another to stop Tirek.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Princess Celestia,Then we must begin at once.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Princess Celestia,"I'm sorry, Princess Twilight, but you must keep your new abilities a secret. I fear that your friends being aware of your new power could put them at great risk. Do you still think you can take on this responsibility?"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Princess Celestia,"You will not prevail, Tirek."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Princess Celestia,We must rid ourselves of our magic before Tirek has the chance to steal it from us.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Princess Celestia,You've been wondering what you are meant to do as a princess. Do you know now?
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Princess Celestia,Then it is unlikely you are meant to take on this task alone.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Princess Celestia,"You are now Twilight Sparkle, the princess of friendship. But what is the princess of friendship without her friends?"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Princess Celestia,"I believe it is yours, Princess Twilight."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Princess Celestia,There is no doubt that Tirek is after Alicorn magic.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Princess Celestia,[out of breath] It is done.
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Princess Celestia,I'm afraid not!
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Princess Celestia,"Thank you, Twilight. I am quite looking forward to just enjoying the Gala for once."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Princess Celestia,You have nothing to apologize for. This has been the most fun Gala in years!
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Princess Celestia,"I must say, it's been very nice having you take over some of the planning responsibilities for this year's Gala."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Princess Celestia,I know! Can you imagine how dull it would have been if I hadn't invited Discord? Come on! Whoo! The night is still young!
Slice of Life,Princess Celestia,"[hushed] Well, we can't just come to this wedding empty-hoofed!"
Slice of Life,Princess Celestia,[hushed] What do you mean you left it on the counter?!
Slice of Life,Princess Celestia,"[hushed] [groans] Well, this is just wonderful!"
Slice of Life,Princess Celestia,"[hushed] Next time, you can just bring your own gift, and I'll bring mine."
Princess Spike,Princess Celestia,"You delegates have traveled far and wide to represent your cities as we seek to celebrate and learn from all the unique places that make up our wonderful land of Equestria. At tonight's welcome reception, Princess Cadance will dedicate this beautiful friendship statue made up of gemstones from each of your home cities."
Princess Spike,Princess Celestia,Now I'd like to turn things over to the one who organized the summit: Princess Twilight Sparkle!
Party Pooped,Princess Celestia,And you did a wonderful job of it. You and your friends.
Party Pooped,Princess Celestia,"I am very impressed, princess."
The Crystalling - Part 1,Princess Celestia,It appears her magic is more powerful than that of a newborn unicorn!
The Crystalling - Part 1,Princess Celestia,"In light of the little one's abilities, this Crystalling might be more important than ever. [to Cadance] Perhaps you should address your subjects and remind them of that."
The Crystalling - Part 1,Princess Celestia,The birth of an Alicorn is something Equestria has never seen!
The Crystalling - Part 2,Princess Celestia,"Push them back, my sister!"
The Crystalling - Part 2,Princess Celestia,An old student of mine believes he does.
The Crystalling - Part 2,Princess Celestia,"I wouldn't advise it, Rainbow Dash. Those storm clouds are not like the ones you know."
The Crystalling - Part 2,Princess Celestia,Perhaps.
The Crystalling - Part 2,Princess Celestia,"I'm afraid Twilight is correct, and the storm clouds are already forming."
The Crystalling - Part 2,Princess Celestia,"We will do what we can, but you must hurry."
The Crystalling - Part 2,Princess Celestia,"Indeed. I'm glad to see you've found a way to share your unique gift, Sunburst. You may be more of a wizard than you think."
Gauntlet of Fire,Princess Celestia,There's usually some crisis we have to deal with. Somepony always needs our help. But today<U+0097>
Gauntlet of Fire,Princess Celestia,Dragons glow whenever the Dragon Lord has need of them in the Dragon Lands.
Gauntlet of Fire,Princess Celestia,Be very careful. The Dragon Lands are particularly dangerous for ponies. It would be wise to be discreet.
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Princess Celestia,"Thorax, as the new leader of the changelings, I look forward to discussing how we can improve our relationship in the future. However, for the moment, perhaps it is best that we leave the Changeling Kingdom to the changelings."
Celestial Advice,Princess Celestia,Heh. Go on.
Celestial Advice,Princess Celestia,"It's a wonderful feeling, isn't it? Watching your student shine the way you always knew they could."
Celestial Advice,Princess Celestia,[voiceover] I kept you in Canterlot longer than I should have.
Celestial Advice,Princess Celestia,"Let me tell you a story. Once upon a time, there was a very bright young filly."
Celestial Advice,Princess Celestia,[voiceover] She was truly one of my best students.
Celestial Advice,Princess Celestia,"[voiceover] I knew there was a special group of fillies in Ponyville, but I kept inventing all kinds of reasons why I shouldn't send you."
Celestial Advice,Princess Celestia,"What if she runs into a manticore? Or what if she gets pulled into Tartarus? Or, worst of all, what if she doesn't get along with anypony?!"
Celestial Advice,Princess Celestia,I can only imagine what that feels like.
Celestial Advice,Princess Celestia,"Oh, Twilight, I'm not. I'm laughing because I had the exact same fears you're having."
Celestial Advice,Princess Celestia,"Hmm. I was not aware that I was an expression. An appropriate one, of course, for even I don't know the answer. This is a momentous decision. You must consider all the possibilities."
Celestial Advice,Princess Celestia,"Maybe I could close the library or throw a party in the castle. Oh, she'd have to talk to the other fillies then! Oh. I must send her away."
Celestial Advice,Princess Celestia,"I loved having you as a student. You challenged me and taught me just as much as I taught you. I am embarrassed to admit it, but I was afraid if you made friends, you wouldn't need me anymore."
Celestial Advice,Princess Celestia,"Eventually, I realized all the anxiety I felt was because I didn't want you to go."
Celestial Advice,Princess Celestia,And that's why we're proud and honored to give them the Equestrian Pink Hearts of Courage!
Celestial Advice,Princess Celestia,So you have an overachieving student. Sounds familiar.
Celestial Advice,Princess Celestia,"This seems like a lovely path for Starlight. The changelings have so much to learn about how to enjoy love through friendships. Starlight would be busy for a very long time, but her work there would be very rewarding."
Celestial Advice,Princess Celestia,"[voiceover] Uh, yes, Spike. I had a decision to make. Oh, but it wasn't easy."
Celestial Advice,Princess Celestia,"And if you're still worried, you can always make her write you letters."
Celestial Advice,Princess Celestia,"Only you can make that decision. It's a difficult one, but your heart knows what's right, even as it hurts."
Celestial Advice,Princess Celestia,"[voiceover] Yes, Spike. I was constantly surprised and impressed with her discoveries. But I noticed that her pursuit of academia was preventing her from reaching her full potential."
A Royal Problem,Princess Celestia,"All right. Everypony's asleep. You're talking to yourself, Celestia. Heh. But there's nopony else to talk to! [chuckles] Yet. I can talk to ponies in their dreams!"
A Royal Problem,Princess Celestia,I believe that one means your mission is complete.
A Royal Problem,Princess Celestia,"Oh, hello, Starlight. I don't know about you, but I feel very well-rested. Where's Luna?"
A Royal Problem,Princess Celestia,[sighs] Perhaps. But she is like this every morning.
A Royal Problem,Princess Celestia,Excuse me?
A Royal Problem,Princess Celestia,"Oh! Heh. H-How... eh, nice. Ahem. [chews, gags, gulps] They're... delicious. Heh. Thank you."
A Royal Problem,Princess Celestia,"Now, to save some ponies from their nightmares. Which aren't real, so it shouldn't be too hard, right? Right. Good call, Celestia! And I'm talking to myself again."
A Royal Problem,Princess Celestia,"You think I don't get tired? I'm exhausted! Oh, I apologize for not noticing flowers in a wall sconce. But by the time I get to retire for the night, I can barely see straight! Even so, I still make an effort to smile!"
A Royal Problem,Princess Celestia,Starlight! I'm here now. Tell me what's wrong.
A Royal Problem,Princess Celestia,But my magic isn't powerful enough! I thought if we worked together...!
A Royal Problem,Princess Celestia,It was just what we needed. The experience has made us closer than ever.
A Royal Problem,Princess Celestia,No! I'll never turn into you!
A Royal Problem,Princess Celestia,It's Starlight Glimmer's. She's afraid this is what will happen if we continue to fight!
A Royal Problem,Princess Celestia,[serious] What?
A Royal Problem,Princess Celestia,"Um, a little."
A Royal Problem,Princess Celestia,"Oh, Luna, I can't do this! I was wrong! Your job is so incredibly hard! You have to battle nightmares and work in the darkness and do it all alone! It takes such a brave, strong pony to do what you do!"
A Royal Problem,Princess Celestia,"That's not true! Even when we were apart, I knew I needed her!"
A Royal Problem,Princess Celestia,"No, you're not! You are not real, and you will never exist again!"
A Royal Problem,Princess Celestia,"Good morning, sister! Join us?"
A Royal Problem,Princess Celestia,"And yet you know exactly what it's like to be me?! Oh, please!"
Shadow Play - Part 1,Princess Celestia,"I've always wondered what happened to Star Swirl. This is quite a discovery, Sunburst."
Shadow Play - Part 1,Princess Celestia,"My Olde Ponish is a bit rusty, but I wonder if the answers can be found somewhere within the pages of this book."
Shadow Play - Part 1,Princess Celestia,You might find you need help.
Shadow Play - Part 1,Princess Celestia,It appears so.
Shadow Play - Part 2,Princess Celestia,"Well, it has been over a thousand years. Will you stay here and teach magic once again? My sister and I have such fond memories of your lessons."
Shadow Play - Part 2,Princess Celestia,Then I hope you will return to Canterlot on occasion and share the wisdom of your great experience with the next generation of ponies.
School Daze - Part 1,Princess Celestia,That's a very<U+0097>
School Daze - Part 1,Princess Celestia,"Oh, well, that's<U+0097>"
School Daze - Part 1,Princess Celestia,Of course not. You've never run a school before. The Equestria Education Association is a board of learned ponies that oversee every school in Equestria.
School Daze - Part 1,Princess Celestia,It really d<U+0097>
School Daze - Part 1,Princess Celestia,"Not even a princess can do whatever she likes when it comes to shaping young pony minds. The EEA ensures that whether it's unicorns studying magic, Pegasi learning weather, or Earth ponies researching agriculture, all schools are held to the same high standard. They'll need to approve your plan before you can move forward."
School Daze - Part 1,Princess Celestia,"[giggles] Oh, Twilight. You were my star pupil. If anyone knows how to run a school, it's you."
School Daze - Part 1,Princess Celestia,"Actually, there is. The EEA guidebook is very specific about how to run a school."
School Daze - Part 1,Princess Celestia,"I think a school of friendship is a wonderful idea, Twilight! I'll help in any way I can."
School Daze - Part 2,Princess Celestia,"I seem to recall something about Earth ponies, unicorns, and Pegasi doing something similar, don't you?"
School Daze - Part 2,Princess Celestia,"Please, everycreature! If you can just explain what happened..."
School Daze - Part 2,Princess Celestia,"Hold on, please! I'm sure Princess Twilight Sparkle has a good explanation for all of this."
School Daze - Part 2,Princess Celestia,"Find the students quickly, Twilight, or I fear our world will be at war!"
School Daze - Part 2,Princess Celestia,Twilight! I was so relieved to get your letter!
Horse Play,Princess Celestia,"Yes. But let's celebrate later. Right now, we have a show to do!"
Horse Play,Princess Celestia,Oh! Goodness! This theater does have strong acoustics. M-My apologies. I'm still learning to hone my craft.
Horse Play,Princess Celestia,"You're welcome, Twilight. But from now on, none of you will have to call me ""Princess"" anymore."
Horse Play,Princess Celestia,"I'm afraid I haven't much to say, Twilight."
Horse Play,Princess Celestia,[whispering] Spike! Improvise!
Horse Play,Princess Celestia,"No. I had so much fun tonight, I've decided to give up my crown, step down from the throne, and devote all of my time to the theater!"
Horse Play,Princess Celestia,What box?
Horse Play,Princess Celestia,Then I would be delighted to join your theater troupe!
Horse Play,Princess Celestia,"Well, if you're sure..."
Horse Play,Princess Celestia,"[rushed and hyperactive] It's time for a new day in Equestria! [normal] Uh, how was that?"
Horse Play,Princess Celestia,"Thank you so much, Twilight! This is what I always knew theater must be about <U+0096> that special stage pony bond of shared trust and honesty."
Horse Play,Princess Celestia,Mmmm... nothing. Oh! The classroom floor under my hooves! Does that count?
Horse Play,Princess Celestia,[flat and stilted] It is time for a new day in Equestria-aaa.
Horse Play,Princess Celestia,"My... ""ones-versary""?"
Horse Play,Princess Celestia,"Oh! Uh, right! Of course! Heh. [clears throat] [quietly] It is time for a new day in Equestria."
Horse Play,Princess Celestia,"The pleasure is all mine! If there's anything I can do to become a better Equestrian thespian, I will! What do you have planned?"
Horse Play,Princess Celestia,You're not the only ones. What did you have in mind?
Horse Play,Princess Celestia,"Fortunately, I know a thing or two about how to deal with those."
Horse Play,Princess Celestia,"Your invitation is very kind, but are you certain it's wise? I have no acting experience at all."
Horse Play,Princess Celestia,"[with wildly varying tone] Come on, Star Swirl. Throw off that must-Y hat and let's have a... a dance!"
School Raze - Part 1,Princess Celestia,"On the second day, creatures will lose their magic abilities."
School Raze - Part 1,Princess Celestia,"And finally, magical artifacts will stop working. When the sun sets on the third day, the magic in our world will be gone forever!"
School Raze - Part 1,Princess Celestia,"Thank you, all. We will search for ways to protect Equestria in your absence."
School Raze - Part 1,Princess Celestia,"If he has found some way to escape his prison or work from within it, he could be responsible for this."
School Raze - Part 1,Princess Celestia,"Star Swirl believes the power will drain from our land in three days. First, unicorn magic and spells will fail."
School Raze - Part 1,Princess Celestia,Ah! It is even more terrible than we feared! Magic is disappearing all across Equestria!
School Raze - Part 1,Princess Celestia,"Throughout our city, ponies have been reporting tales of their magic failing. Spells going wrong. Potions not working."
School Raze - Part 2,Princess Celestia,Magic is disappearing all across Equestria!
School Raze - Part 2,Princess Celestia,"As for Cozy Glow, I can assure you <U+0097> where she's going, she won't be causing any more trouble."
