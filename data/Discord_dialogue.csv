pony,dialog
Discord,"Odd. I was trying to take us right to Fluttershy, but there is no Fluttershy."
Discord,What?
Discord,"Yes, so many other friends. [whimpers] Farewell, Garbunkle the magician and brave Sir McBiggun. May providence smile upon thee in thy quest to rid Spiketopia of the dreaded Squizard... [sighs] When I say it that way, the game doesn't sound half bad."
Discord,Because you and I don't make sense to anypony else.
Discord,Whatever do you mean?
Discord,"Ohhhh, that's not good..."
Discord,"[laughing] Oh, my stomach! Twilight, you've got to see what I just did."
Discord,"Yes, because that's what you did!"
Discord,"And her little dragon, too."
Discord,"Oh, pfft, come skating with me, and we'll let bygones be bygones."
Discord,[clears throat] [mumbling] I'm listening.
Discord,It is certainly a pleasure to have such dedicated fans. I'll have to come back with some new material after I rescue Fluttershy.
Discord,"Why the angry eyes? You love passing tests. It's not because my little exam put a damper on your visit with Princess Cadance, is it? Made it so that there was no time for you two to focus on your friendship?"
Discord,"Oh, now where was I? Ah, yes, we had just finished our soup, and then Applejack said, [imitating Applejack] ""Peanut butter hoof? Yuck, not even with jelly!"""
Discord,"Oh. Well, it does, very much so. You're so very kind, my dear Fluttershy. I always knew that you were the understanding one, not like those nasty friends of yours."
Discord,I never thought of that...
Discord,Or perhaps these things just take time.
Discord,Exactly!
Discord,Haven't you girls just learned so much?
Discord,"Why are you here again? I mean, it's not like you're going to stop the changelings by pulling a rabbit out of a hat. At least my magic can do something."
Discord,"Probably because you're not as close as you think you are. [laughs] Just kidding. She wanted it to be a big surprise. Just between us, she's getting ready to make a big announcement!"
Discord,"[to himself] Oh, here we go..."
Discord,"No, no, no, no, no! I've been taking advantage of your hospitality for far too long. It's high time I do something about it. What to do, what to do..."
Discord,"""Now that she's a princess, maybe she's decided that she's too good for you."""
Discord,Oh! You realized how amazing I am and that I make you cooler just by being around me?
Discord,"May I take your... [clears throat] hats, ladies?"
Discord,"[laughter] Make sense? Oh, what fun is there in making sense?"
Discord,"I owe you an apology, Smooze. I spent the whole evening thinking about my own feelings and never thinking about yours."
Discord,"[laughs] Oh, that's adorable. But you see, unlike you, I can do anything."
Discord,"Oh, dear. That might be a problem."
Discord,"You did summon me for a rousing Guys' Night of Ogres & Oubliettes, did you not?"
Discord,Tweezers!
Discord,"I like it better my way, but... I guess when you're friends, you can't always have things exactly your way all the time, eh?"
Discord,[laughing] You should see yourselves right now. The expressions on your face. So intense. So sure of yourselves. [laughing] Hilarious!
Discord,"Oh, I never dream of such things. Ask Princess Luna."
Discord,It's hardly different. Your friends laugh at you all the time.
Discord,"[California accent] Yo! Greetings, fellow creatures!"
Discord,You!
Discord,"Oh, my! I do love a good accessory. I suppose that's Rarity's influence."
Discord,And while I get a little rest A teeny tiny small request Some codfish oil for my chest Poured from a crystal cruet
Discord,"Spike, she's an imaginary one-dimensional paper cutout skeleton."
Discord,"Actually, madam, I'm talking to myself."
Discord,Whatever Twilight's planning for Starlight is going to be so exciting!
Discord,"Oh, this is so strange. We're here and that's there, and I clearly meant for us to be there and not here."
Discord,[blows] A what?
Discord,"Bravo, ladies, bravo! How ever did you save the day this time? Blast the beastie with your magic necklaces, I presume? Where are those little trinkets of yours? You know, the ones you use to send me back to my extremely uncomfortable stone prison?"
Discord,[laughs] Singing ginseng! I'll take it!
Discord,"Well, you two certainly have bought into this romance nonsense hook, line, and sinker."
Discord,A skosh? A skosh?!
Discord,"Yes, yes, yes, of course. Tell me, have you seen Fluttershy anywhere?"
Discord,Yes...
Discord,You certainly are. And I should probably help you get free. But... oh-ho-ho-ho-ho...
Discord,"I already have the best name in the universe. Why would I change it for something like ""Captain Wuzz""?"
Discord,"Well, perhaps we should have another look at the data we've collected. [gasps] Of course! There is one last variable that we haven't accounted for."
Discord,"[laughing] Catch you later, Twilight."
Discord,"Oh, I was wondering when you were going to ask me. I'd love to."
Discord,But then we'd miss out on all those delightful misadventures.
Discord,Did I hear you two talking about Princess Cadance's visit with Princess Twilight?
Discord,"Oh, dear, dear Princesses, I'm sorry to say that I'm sick. [hacks] Blue flu."
Discord,Huh. What's this? No. NO!!!
Discord,"Actually, Pinkie Pie, who are you taking to... I mean, do you... eugh, oh, you know what? I am famished. I'll take all the cakes."
Discord,Nothing. Carry on.
Discord,"Now, listen, Smooze. I need to make this a party of one for a little while. Just stay out here until I come for you."
Discord,"Oh, most definitely."
Discord,"Well, I'll need all my energy when I'm dancing at the Gala, if I decide to go that is. Oh, by the way, are you bringing anypony?"
Discord,"[chuckling] Oh, interesting. Does it decorate your hips in roses or turn you green?"
Discord,I don't think so. Let's have a drink. Chocolate milkshakes?
Discord,"Oh, yes, very well, I will fix it. I only ask one thing in return."
Discord,"Oh, I hate seeing you like this, Big Mac. And over a girl, no less. I'm calling an emergency Guys' Night [poof!] right now to cheer you up."
Discord,I think you'll be quite pleased with the green tea I've selected for us today.
Discord,"[laughter] Chaos is a wonderful, wonderful thing."
Discord,Really? I thought there must be some mistake.
Discord,It's for Fluttershy!
Discord,We literally trotted for our lives. Isn't that hilarious?
Discord,[reverberating] [laughs] Aren't games fun?
Discord,[chuckles] I'm learning so much. Aren't you?
Discord,[scoffs] Consider it considered.
Discord,"[gulps] Oh, we were just reminiscing about the best weekend ever!"
Discord,Did you ever notice how you always materialize out of thin air? Why not thick air? What's the deal there?
Discord,"Well, whatever do you mean? This is just me being me."
Discord,Darn it. I was hoping you would send her to my realm. We could've been roomies. Way to not pick up what I was putting down.
Discord,"Oh, well."
Discord,But we're not done yet.
Discord,"Shining Armor, why, whatever are you doing here?"
Discord,"Oh, come on!"
Discord,"[whispering] Yes, what did she do to deserve this?"
Discord,"Oh, you must be Rainbow Dash, famed for her loyalty, the Element of Harmony you represent."
Discord,"Yes, Princess, I'm ready to use my magic for good instead of evil. [under his breath] Most of the time."
Discord,But how was I supposed to know for sure that I'm truly still friends with one of the most important ponies around?
Discord,"We need to make this place more Fluttershy and less, well, me."
Discord,"Don't you laugh at me, Big Mac! Does it really say that? Let me see."
Discord,We'll see about that.
Discord,[weakly] But you said this was a sign of your gratitude and loyalty. A gift from someone close to you.
Discord,"[sarcastic] Well, that's reassuring."
Discord,"Well, of course we're friends! She gets me, and you obviously do not! [imitating ""Jasmine Leaf""] ""Are you sure you're friends with Fluttershy?"" [scoffs] The very nerve!"
Discord,"Just knowing that I have a good friend like you to take care of me has made me feel better already. I'll be fine here on my own. Oh, just before you go, just a little small request."
Discord,[laughter] It's just too entertaining.
Discord,There is one way...
Discord,"Well, I didn't think that they should interrupt you. But now I see that we should have. Oh, I feel just terrible."
Discord,Twilight! This makes twice I'm seeing you in one day! Aren't I lucky?
Discord,You aren't kidding.
Discord,I don't suppose you brought any throne-destroying tools along with these useless sideshow props.
Discord,"I suppose I could, but after all the hoof pointing and besmirching of my good name, I just don't know if I'm up to it."
Discord,"Actually, I was going to say a couple of those illusions were slightly above average. If you ever need a little chaos in your act, let me know."
Discord,"And that's why you're the party expert. Thank you, Pinkie Pie. I feel so much better now."
Discord,Because you... what?!
Discord,I'm not intelligent? I cast it anyway because this game is stupid.
Discord,"Now, look who's a liar. Anyone can plainly see that I'm not big at all."
Discord,"Yes, yes, yes, of course. It's just that I couldn't help but notice that Twilight hasn't yet opened this little chest of hers. I-I-It got me thinking, what if what's locked inside is something that could help her prove her royal worth? I only bring it up because she said that she's been feeling like her role as a princess doesn't equate to much."
Discord,Tea?
Discord,"The beautiful Rarity, representing the element of generosity, if I'm not mistaken?"
Discord,"Calico's Ring of Imperceptibility isn't going to reclaim itself, you know."
Discord,Have fun at the Gala!
Discord,"Oh, you mean like trapping best friend ponies in hedge mazes and turning them against each other. Those were the days."
Discord,"Obviously, you should have a grand master plan for her, the same way Celestia set you on the path that eventually made you a princess."
Discord,Maybe it's not as bad as I think. Maybe Fluttershy would be comfortable having a tea party here.
Discord,"[laughter] Everypony has to play, or the game is over and I win."
Discord,"I accept! I mean, I-I-I suppose I can find some time in my busy schedule to help you out. But I will need my own office, expense account, parking space..."
Discord,"I've only got these tiny mismatched wings, and even I can fly better than Twilight Sparkle! Am I right? Pchoo!"
Discord,"I said, Orange you glad I've changed?"
Discord,Fine. But I don't do windows.
Discord,"Who cares? I can do whatever I want, whenever I want. I'm Discord, the master of chaos! You think you can boss Discord around? You think I'm just going to turn all this back because you say so? Because if I don't, I'll lose the one friend I ever had? [pause] Oh. Oh. Well played, Fluttershy. Well played."
Discord,"No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no. No, he's not. Let me see that."
Discord,[muffled and out of focus] You might be a Ponyville pony when an ordinary night on the town ends in a lesson about friendship! [in focus] Knock knock!
Discord,"Fun? With sidekicks? Oh, you must think that we're in a dimension where everything is opposite. [snap] ""Da-dee-la! I'm Opposite Discord, and I want to hang out with Spike and Big Mac! I'm sure I'd have fun!"""
Discord,Now why in the world would I ever try to do a thing like that?
Discord,"Sir McBiggun, I'd cover the entrance if I were you."
Discord,This can't be. I'm supposed to feel sorry for you because I'm me and you're you.
Discord,"Oh, Twilight's friend and Applejack's monosyllabic brother, if only I weren't super busy this evening."
Discord,"Yes, you can. Your finest tea set, please. I want only the best for my friend Fluttershy."
Discord,"That box contains your wings. You can take them and leave the game, or you can carry on aimlessly wandering this maze. Your choice."
Discord,Its schedule was free.
Discord,"Ohoho, but that's not all! When I went to look for them again, they were on the ceiling!"
Discord,Boo.
Discord,I may have let it slip that you'd be unveiling your big plan for Starlight tonight. Silly me. But we're all very excited to hear what you've cooked up.
Discord,"Oh, of course, her trip to see the Breezies. Ah, yes, I had forgotten that was today."
Discord,So I'm able to rip the very fabric of reality again.
Discord,[accented] Garbunkle! Follow my lead!
Discord,"Well, Twilight was just about to reveal her grand master plan for you."
Discord,"Well, then lucky for you. We're here."
Discord,Phew!
Discord,Give me that!
Discord,Disturb them? I wouldn't dream of it. Not when I have two such dear friends of my own who have already offered to take care of me. And at such peril! This flu of mine is highly- [snorts] [sneezes] contagious.
Discord,Isn't this what every gamer wants? To live the game? Like this?!
Discord,Better?
Discord,"Whatever it is, it can only get better by adding me to the mix."
Discord,"Oh, get on with it."
Discord,My ears were burning.
Discord,Fluttershy?
Discord,"Oh, I know much more than that, honest Applejack."
Discord,"[through mock tears] I hate goodbyes, don't you? I just go to pieces."
Discord,"[laughing] Welcome to your lucky day, Rarity. You've found the one thing in Equestria that could rival my face for sheer beauty. What do you think? You like?"
Discord,"I'm sorry to interrupt, but I just noticed something."
Discord,I guess every being in Equestria is funny today.
Discord,"Oh, well. If at first you don't succeed..."
Discord,"Who, me?"
Discord,Is something amiss?
Discord,Too bad there won't be a date.
Discord,[weakly] I didn't. I truly didn't.
Discord,"Oh, please. I have better things to do than to watch that thing all night. [laughs nervously] What I mean to say is, that thing is a dear, dear friend, and I'll make sure that the ooze, uh, that he can't help but secrete doesn't get on anypony else."
Discord,"You weren't coming up with a plan just now, were you? Oh, dear. This could be pretty embarrassing for you."
Discord,"I came to find the one pony who truly understands me and could nurse me back to health. Where is that dear, sweet Fluttershy? I need attention! I need some care! I need-"
Discord,Huh. Have you tried the scones? They're positively delectable. The secret is in the extra butter.
Discord,How can they be happy if they aren't playing Ogres & Oubliettes?
Discord,"Well, it's decent chaos. I don't know if I'd call it ""total""."
Discord,"Oh, this looks like..."
Discord,Just like in real life?
Discord,"Oh, you ponies are just the most fun I've had in aeons."
Discord,This is what you were hoping for? But this is the complete opposite of your tea parties.
Discord,I'll be grateful for your charity Until the bitter end Because I've heard that tenderness Is what you lend an ailing friend
Discord,Psst! I see what you're doing.
Discord,Uh... [stuttering] I don't know what you're getting at.
Discord,Shall I continue?
Discord,[laughs] How interesting. That reminds me of something I heard at the market today.
Discord,"[chuckles] Well, with a few surprises."
Discord,Hello!
Discord,I'm reformed. Don't you remember? Why don't you ask your zebra friend?
Discord,"[eating] Are you sure this isn't overdoing it? You said to make myself at home while you were gone, but I wouldn't want to overstep my bounds."
Discord,"Lesson two <U+0096> plenty of ponies in the pasture. Right, Big Mac? I know just the gal to make you forget all about Sugar Belle."
Discord,"Well, I'm glad you got that, because that's what is true. We are."
Discord,I have no idea. Those seeds I planted should have sprouted up ages ago.
Discord,Mm-hmm.
Discord,"I for one found it delightful. Sort of a one-pony theater piece, if you will. You should really consider taking it on the road."
Discord,"""Not intelligent enough."" Please."
Discord,[menacingly] Where?
Discord,"To fill in for Twilight, of course, as head-draconequus. I seem to recall a whole song about how this school is where you make your own rules. Now, who better at that than me?"
Discord,You do seem to be turning a shade of... [gasps] orange!
Discord,Carry me?
Discord,"Technically, the fun starts when I arrive, but I'll make sure it's around sunset. Adieu, fellas."
Discord,Lesson one <U+0096> nothing can break your heart if you only love yourself. You've got to show everypony that you're too cool to be bothered with so-called love. Observe.
Discord,"Well, friends! I think I may actually grow to like this multiple-friend thing."
Discord,Maybe I just need another set of eyes on this. What do you think?
Discord,[gasps] So what you're saying is no tea? Ugh. Well. [clears throat] That's fine. I wasn't thirsty anyway.
Discord,"I'm so glad that you're back from your trip, Fluttershy. Just your presence here is making me feel so much better. I was just wondering, could I trouble you for just one more thing?"
Discord,"I so hope you don't mind, Pinkie Pie."
Discord,"Yes, because you did it all by yourself."
Discord,"If I'm the worst, then why did you invite me?"
Discord,I'm just surprised that you agreed to their plan. I never thought you'd be the kind of pony who would think she was better than everypony else.
Discord,"Yes, yes, yes, I believe I got that!"
Discord,"[gasps] Well, it's not my fault the new train route leads into an active volcano. Guess you'll have to stay."
Discord,"Normally, I'm the most distracting thing I can think of, but without magic..."
Discord,"[sips tea] It did rain the other day, however."
Discord,"Oh, I doubt that. [munching] Hungry? [voice over] Well, obviously things didn't go according to my original plan. My plunderseeds should have stolen the magic from the Tree of Harmony and captured Princess Celestia and Princess Luna thousands of moons ago. Alas, it seems the tree had enough magic to keep the seeds from growing up big and strong. Until now, that is."
Discord,"So, who's ready for my big reprise?"
Discord,I haven't walked that far in a millennia!
Discord,Are we sure that I'll get my magic back when we destroy this throne thingy?
Discord,"Keep trying, Twilight Sparkle. [mockingly] Maybe the magic of friendship can help you. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some chaos to wreak."
Discord,I just needed some assurance that you truly considered this a team effort. And now I have it.
Discord,Oh. I can see why you like these clouds so much. Very plush.
Discord,"Oh, wonderful! I'll be enjoying her company tomorrow, so I will be needing your very best tea, please. Something especially special."
Discord,"Oh, yes. Awful business, that. Mm."
Discord,Oh! You remembered to cut off the crusts for me.
Discord,"Oh, you keep saying that, but I haven't seen an actual changeling since we got into this hive."
Discord,"Oh, yes. Thank you, Fluttershy, for your concern. If only your pony friends could be as considerate..."
Discord,Excuse me. Is this where Fluttershy usually buys her tea?
Discord,"[singing] Winter Wrap Up, Winter Wrap-ooh! [laughs] Now, Twilight, you know Princess Celestia said that you were to give me a heads up before you summon me with that little spell she gave you. In case you haven't noticed, I was in the middle of a particularly invigorating shower."
Discord,A teapot that just pours tea? How positively dreadful!
Discord,Relax. I'm not going to hurt you. I'm simply going to send you to another dimension. I can't have you interfering in my relationship with Fluttershy anymore!
Discord,[sneezes] [sniffs] Oh...
Discord,Ohhhhhh... it was this table here.
Discord,"Well, not yet, technically. In fact, she can't break your heart if you break hers first."
Discord,"Me, too! I'm so excited! I can't wait! No, really, I can't! How about we have the tea party tomorrow afternoon?"
Discord,That bad?
Discord,"Oh, good. I'm sure she can't wait to hear all about it."
Discord,"Uh... [stuttering] No, I suppose not. It would just mean that I'd have different friends for different things... Oh, oh, dear, it looks like I've perhaps overreacted just a skosh."
Discord,Tough crowd.
Discord,"[not listening] Go on, I'm listening."
Discord,"Well, [clears throat] you'll want to head north, turn left, th<U+0097> Oh... You know, it'd be much easier if I took you there myself."
Discord,"Oh, I do hope she breaks into a song this time!"
Discord,"[chuckling] Did you miss me, Celestia? I missed you. It's quite lonely being encased in stone, but you wouldn't know that, would you, because I don't turn ponies into stone."
Discord,"Well, let me try and paint her a picture, dearest."
Discord,"Well, well, well, I see you've found the Elements of Harmony. How terrifying!"
Discord,"[thud] Oh, poo."
Discord,"Huh. Quite strange. For the first time in my life, I don't feel quite strange. In fact, I feel... completely normal. Everything is finally perfect for Fluttershy."
Discord,I'll have you know that I have only one cloven hoof. Such accusations. And here I thought we were friends.
Discord,[grimly] Why is this so late?
Discord,Right here.
Discord,"There you go. Back to normal, just the way you like it. See you tomorrow!"
Discord,You did.
Discord,"You meant our will, didn't you?"
Discord,"Make Fluttershy feel comfortable, make Fluttershy feel comfortable, comfortable, comfortable... Well, I mean, that shouldn't be a problem."
Discord,[groans] Alright. [quickly] Friendship is magic.
Discord,"You already planned the perfect moment during the party to make the grand announcement to everypony about your plan. Brava, Twilight! I can't wait to tell your plan to Fluttershy and the others!"
Discord,Gone? Gone?
Discord,"Oh, you wouldn't dare turn me back to stone and risk disappointing your precious princess."
Discord,One change to the equation could ruin the experiment. Twilight said so herself. Anything stand out as being different? Anything at all?
Discord,"Oh, he did not! And what did you say?"
Discord,"Okay, let's give these conversation cards a whirl. [clears throat, reading] ""It is very nice to see you today."" ""Have you read any good books lately?"" ""Your garden looks positively lovely."""
Discord,"Slipped my mind. On a hill at the very edge of Equestria, there grows an exquisite magic flower. Pick the flower as it drops its petals at sunset. Then you can make a magical soothing elixir to cure the blue flu."
Discord,"A guys' night? You mean a rowdy evening of reckless revelry? Zoot suits, fedoras, swing dancing?"
Discord,Is this seat taken?
Discord,[sniffing] This smells... uh... palatable.
Discord,You've gotta be kidding. You don't remember me?
Discord,This seems like one of those moments where we need a plan.
Discord,"Hey there, Fluttershy, you want a turn? The water's great!"
Discord,"[singing faster] My goodness, I'm a nincompoop Because I fear I've got the croup I need a vat of pumpkin soup And scarves made out of zinnias"
Discord,"Oh, for goodness sake! You've been kind for far too long, my dear. Time to be cruel. Arrivederci!"
Discord,"Fascinating article, yes? [nervous laugh] [hushed, to himself] Don't let them come over, please don't let them come over, please don't let them come over, please, please, please<U+0097> [normal] Oh, salutations, my friend! Wish I could stay and chat, but I don't want to."
Discord,"Oh, poo! I just ordered business cards!"
Discord,You felt sorry for me?
Discord,I'm just so new at this whole friendship thing. It's so much more complicated than it looks.
Discord,Yes. I'd say we were both fairly interested.
Discord,Anytime. I really do love being helpful.
Discord,"I'm a realist. And love, like all things warm and fuzzy, isn't real."
Discord,Oh! Some thanks for all my help. And after I hired all those substitute teachers for you.
Discord,"Hey, I'm here to deliver a message."
Discord,Ta-da! Happy Hearts and Hooves Day!
Discord,"Or we could go cause a little mischief. I know a trick that'll turn Celestia's castle into cheese. Do you think it's a ""gouda"" idea? [laughs] That's just the first of many cheese jokes if we go down this path."
Discord,Very close.
Discord,"Well, I was in my thinking tree <U+0096> that's where I do most of my really deep thinking <U+0096> I was there, and I said to myself, I said, ""Discord, your friend Twilight says that she's your pal, but she never writes and she never pops in for a visit."""
Discord,"[muffled] Oh, but you are, Fluttershy. You're the pony that taught me that friendship is magic. I had magic and friendship, and now I don't have either."
Discord,"Yes, but when the throne is destroyed, I'll be able to rip the very fabric of reality to save our friends, while you'll still be a self-absorbed, below-average illusionist!"
Discord,"Oh, well, I'm sure it is. Well, I must be off."
Discord,It has only served to prove that moments of levity and bonding between friends simply cannot be recreated so that others might share in the experience.
Discord,Inadequate hoof and claw washing?
Discord,"[snorts] Yes, Twilight."
Discord,Whoops! [chuckles] I'm so sorry!
Discord,"Well, that's okay, because I've never hosted a tea party before."
Discord,"Indeed. How would Twilight nurse me back to health if she were sick too? You will be letting me stay at your place until I'm all better, won't you?"
Discord,Fine. Call it a gentleman's wager. Loser mows my lawn for eternity.
Discord,You really do make the best finger foods.
Discord,Of course none of this would've happened if I hadn't encouraged everypony not to invite you this weekend.
Discord,"Oh, what a brilliant idea! Shall we begin with the lunch date that kicked off the glorious weekend you missed out on?"
Discord,Oh. I never realized how much work you put into hosting these tea parties.
Discord,"Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no! I mean, while she's gone, you ponies can take care of me! Isn't that what friends are for, taking care of each other? [laughs] Let the healing begin!"
Discord,I wouldn't be so sure.
Discord,Keep your eye on the pie. [<e0> la Doug Henning] It's magic time!
Discord,"Pinkie Pie! Just the pony I need. [snaps fingers] As the party pony and Fluttershy's close <U+0096> but not best <U+0096> friend, I need your advice. I'm hosting a tea party for her, and it has to be perfect. No! It has to be even better than perfect!"
Discord,Do you even know what you just said?
Discord,"Of course. ""Love is... something-something, and Discord is great."" I don't know. Can we play O&O now?"
Discord,"Well, if you think that you can do any better, be my guest!"
Discord,I'm sorry. Do you validate?
Discord,"Oopsie-doopsie, I almost left with the little journal you've all been keeping. What a fascinating read. Haven't you girls just learned so much? I've bookmarked a few of the more interesting passages. You really should take a look! [to Fluttershy, hushed] We're still on for tea later, aren't we, Fluttershy?"
Discord,"Oh, I better take this. Hello?"
Discord,"Oh, no, I haven't touched that one yet."
Discord,Ta-da!
Discord,Who do you think broke Sugar Belle's wagon wheel?
Discord,"You? [laughs] Of course not! You think I don't have other friends? I'm centuries old! I was talking about the Smooze! Smooze Face, the Smoozinator <U+0096> well, I mean that's what we called him back in college. Smooze! I would like you to meet Fluttershy and, um, hmm... Tree... how'd you say it... Tree Embrace?"
Discord,You know what? Cancel my order.
Discord,Mmwah! Mmwah!
Discord,"[laughing] This is the life! Jazz, dancing, the best table magic can buy! This is what guys' night is all about. Am I right, fellas?"
Discord,Class is now in session.
Discord,"Oh, dear Fluttershy, worry not. I can assure you that for the first time, I'm feeling perfectly normal. Now, let me top you off."
Discord,What do you say?
Discord,How boring. Pass. Hold on! Ginseng tea! Now that sounds promising. What does it sing? I'm partial to something upbeat and jazzy.
Discord,"[gravelly accent] June, honey, be a dear. Reschedule Luna and Cay-Cay. [normal, aside] That's what I call Princess Celestia, what a hoot! [gravelly accent] In fact, clear the whole evening. Tonight is guys' night. These fellas invited me to spice things up and bring a little class to the whole affair."
Discord,"I know. I was afraid that if you saw exactly how different we are, you wouldn't want to be friends anymore."
Discord,[hushed] They took Fluttershy?
Discord,Can I trouble you for another sugarcube?
Discord,"Mmmm, my, my, my. You do seem like you're in over your head. Won't Twilight be so disappointed with how you're ruining<U+0097>I mean, running her school?"
Discord,"Thank you, Twilight. [to Fluttershy, hushed] I'm sorry."
Discord,[chuckles] You read my mind!
Discord,You don't have to tell me that. She gave us a chance when no other pony would.
Discord,You don't know anything about rare creatures. I've known Smooze Face for ages. He's not agitated. He's partying down! Whoo!
Discord,Sit and watch? Fine. We'll play your game. [reverberating] Are you ready to enter the world of Ogres & Oubliettes?
Discord,W-W-What's so funny?
Discord,You seem to be mixing up [poof!] the Lord of Chaos [poof!] with a second-rate clown magician for hire.
Discord,"Isn't it, though? And to think, it would never have happened had I come to the Gala as somepony else's plus-one."
Discord,"[sneezes] [blows nose] Because this condition has left me helpless, simply helpless! Why, I can barely lift a spoon."
Discord,Couldn't I just come with you instead?
Discord,Do something chaotic? I'll try...
Discord,"No, I think you just made them mad."
Discord,"Oh, he's not that bad!"
Discord,Happy now?
Discord,"Oh, back so soon?"
Discord,Surprise!
Discord,"Oh, well, this should do!"
Discord,Of course not. That whole jealousy thing was just a happy accident.
Discord,[shivers] That can't be right.
Discord,"Hi, Twilight! The gang mentioned we'd all be hanging out together today!"
Discord,"Buh-bye, have a nice time! Everything is fine here. Bye bye... Bye bye..."
Discord,"Take a lap, team!"
Discord,"But taking in the sick and the desperate - isn't that what Fluttershy would do? Isn't 'helping' something that friends do for friends? Unless, of course, you're really saying that you're not my friend."
Discord,"[taps microphone] Hello, changelings and changelettes! Believe me, I was just as surprised as you are that I'm here! When I heard that I'd be playing for a bunch of changelings, I was beside myself! Then I realized, it was just one of you."
Discord,"Treezie? Really? Sort of a juvenile nickname, don't you think?"
Discord,"Fluttershy had mentioned that those two were getting together today. Mm-hm. How wonderful for them both. It is so rare that those two get to see one another. I don't know about you, but I sometimes wonder how close they could actually be. All those years apart before being reunited?"
Discord,"Curse myself for attending this infernal evening? Ohhh, no, you mean in the game."
Discord,"Oh, we were. But Tirek offered me so much more than just tea parties. Surely you saw this coming."
Discord,Why don't you ask your zebra friend if she knows anything?
Discord,Allow me.
Discord,"Oh, I doubt that. [munching] Hungry? Suit yourselves. Oh! What have you got there?"
Discord,"What's the matter, Pinkie Pie? I thought you appreciated a good laugh?"
Discord,"Oh, this again?"
Discord,"Well, of course I'm sick. The blue skin? These sneezes? Could somebody find me a fainting couch?"
Discord,"And if they're not, this rare opportunity to focus on their friendship will certainly bring them closer. Unless..."
Discord,"Why, thank you, Fluttershy."
Discord,"Oh, how 'bout a different game? [magic zap] Those are very bad cards."
Discord,"[laughs nervously] Uh, well, perhaps you're into more observational humor."
Discord,"I certainly am. You've clearly out-dueled me, and now it's time to meet my fate. I'm prepared to be defeated now, ladies. Fire when ready."
Discord,"[snap] Let me explain it to you as simply as I can. Me? Amazing! Them? Well, I've already forgotten who we're talking about. You see?"
