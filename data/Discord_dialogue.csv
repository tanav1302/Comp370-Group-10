The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,"[laughter] Make sense? Oh, what fun is there in making sense?"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,"[chuckling] Did you miss me, Celestia? I missed you. It's quite lonely being encased in stone, but you wouldn't know that, would you, because I don't turn ponies into stone."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,"Oh, I'd forgotten how grim you can be, Celestia. It's really quite boring."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,"Oh, you must be Rainbow Dash, famed for her loyalty, the Element of Harmony you represent."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,We'll see about that.
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,"The beautiful Rarity, representing the element of generosity, if I'm not mistaken?"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,"Oh, I know much more than that, honest Applejack."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,"You'll get them back in good time. I simply took them to ensure there's no cheating. You see, this is the first rule of our game: no flying, and no magic."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,"What's the matter, Pinkie Pie? I thought you appreciated a good laugh?"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,It's hardly different. Your friends laugh at you all the time.
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,"Oh, poor Pinkie Pie. And here I thought laughter made you happy."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,"[laughing] Welcome to your lucky day, Rarity. You've found the one thing in Equestria that could rival my face for sheer beauty. What do you think? You like?"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,"Oh, for goodness sake! You've been kind for far too long, my dear. Time to be cruel. Arrivederci!"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,Oh. I can see why you like these clouds so much. Very plush.
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,"Hey, I'm here to deliver a message."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,"Listen closely, this is important. A weighty choice is yours to make:<U+00A0>the right selection or a big mistake. If a wrong choice you choose to pursue, the foundations of home will crumble without you."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,"That box contains your wings. You can take them and leave the game, or you can carry on aimlessly wandering this maze. Your choice."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,"[laughter] Everypony has to play, or the game is over and I win."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,"Oh, you ponies are just the most fun I've had in aeons."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,[laughter] It's just too entertaining.
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,"I'm not playing fair? Perhaps we haven't met. I'm Discord, spirit of chaos and disharmony. Hello?"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,"Oh, wait, did you...? [laughter] How funny! You thought the Elements were in the labyrinth?"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,I never said they were in the labyrinth.
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,"Keep trying, Twilight Sparkle. [mockingly] Maybe the magic of friendship can help you. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some chaos to wreak."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,"Beautiful, isn't it? This is the new and improved Ponyville, and these are only my first of changes."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,Picture it. The chaos capital of the world.
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,"Well, wait a few minutes and you'll see it in the beautiful light of day. Or not."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,"Well, well, well, I see you've found the Elements of Harmony. How terrifying!"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,"I certainly am. You've clearly out-dueled me, and now it's time to meet my fate. I'm prepared to be defeated now, ladies. Fire when ready."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,"[laughing] Oh, my stomach! Twilight, you've got to see what I just did."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,"It's priceless! [laughing] Come now, Twilight Sparkle. You've got to get into the spirit of things! After all, this is your new home."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,"[laughter] Chaos is a wonderful, wonderful thing."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,"Oh, this again?"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,"Ugh, gag. Fine, go ahead. Try and use your little Elements. Friend me. Just make it quick. I'm missing some excellent chaos here."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,Huh. What's this? No. NO!!!
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,Oh... [sniggers] He's adorable the way he is.
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,"[blows raspberry] You know what else is adorable? You ponies truly believe that you can reform me, and that you're putting your faith in this one here to make it happen. Makes me wanna pinch your little horsey cheeks..."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,Being turned to stone doesn't keep me from hearing every word Celestia says. Although I admit it makes rolling my eyes a challenge.
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,"Oh, you wouldn't dare turn me back to stone and risk disappointing your precious princess."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,"Oh, yes. Thank you, Fluttershy, for your concern. If only your pony friends could be as considerate..."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,Now why in the world would I ever try to do a thing like that?
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,I never thought of that...
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,"Now, look who's a liar. Anyone can plainly see that I'm not big at all."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,Wh-what?! Look at me! I'm practically reformed already.
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,"Buh-bye, have a nice time! Everything is fine here. Bye bye... Bye bye..."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,"You like carrots, Angel? I'm playing your owner for a fool! [laughs] How d'ya like them carrots?"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,"[eating] Are you sure this isn't overdoing it? You said to make myself at home while you were gone, but I wouldn't want to overstep my bounds."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,"Oh. Well, it does, very much so. You're so very kind, my dear Fluttershy. I always knew that you were the understanding one, not like those nasty friends of yours."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,"Oh, our pony guests! [upper class voice] We're so delighted that you've come. Please, do come in."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,"May I take your... [clears throat] hats, ladies?"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,Allow me.
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,Whoops! [chuckles] I'm so sorry!
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,"Oh, well, I don't know about that. Mistakes happen. Oh, look, everypony, dancing candles!"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,"No, I think you just made them mad."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,"Well, it's hardly my fault if the soup tureen finds the term ""something fishy"" to be offensive."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Discord,"[singing] Winter Wrap Up, Winter Wrap-ooh! [laughs] Now, Twilight, you know Princess Celestia said that you were to give me a heads up before you summon me with that little spell she gave you. In case you haven't noticed, I was in the middle of a particularly invigorating shower."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Discord,"Why, [chuckles] whatever are you talking about?"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Discord,"Don't get me wrong. I absolutely love what you've done with the place, but I couldn't possibly take responsibility. I'm reformed, don't you remember?"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Discord,I'll have you know that I have only one cloven hoof. Such accusations. And here I thought we were friends.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Discord,"Ladies, ladies, I'm innocent. Would I lie to you?"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Discord,"Well then, it seems we've reached an impasse. I'm telling the truth, but you think I'm lying. What do friends like us do in a situation like this, Princess Twilight? Congrats, by the way, on the promotion. You totally deserve it."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Discord,"Well, finally! Somepony willing to give me the benefit of the doubt. The rest of you could learn a lot about friendship from my dear friend Shutterfly here."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Discord,"Oh, right, whatever."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Discord,"I suppose I could, but after all the hoof pointing and besmirching of my good name, I just don't know if I'm up to it."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Discord,Why don't you ask your zebra friend if she knows anything?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,I'm reformed. Don't you remember? Why don't you ask your zebra friend?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,"I for one found it delightful. Sort of a one-pony theater piece, if you will. You should really consider taking it on the road."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,"Oh, I do hope she breaks into a song this time!"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,"Oh, this is so much fun. How about a game of 'Pin the Tail on the Pony'?"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,"Oh, I doubt that. [munching] Hungry? Suit yourselves. Oh! What have you got there?"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,[laughing] You should see yourselves right now. The expressions on your face. So intense. So sure of yourselves. [laughing] Hilarious!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,Ooh-hoo! I'm going to need more popcorn!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,You're welcome! Hmph. No luck finding your tree?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,I'm just surprised that you agreed to their plan. I never thought you'd be the kind of pony who would think she was better than everypony else.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,"[thud] Oh, poo."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,"Bravo, ladies, bravo! How ever did you save the day this time? Blast the beastie with your magic necklaces, I presume? Where are those little trinkets of yours? You know, the ones you use to send me back to my extremely uncomfortable stone prison?"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,Gone? Gone?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,Fine. But I don't do windows.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,I have no idea. Those seeds I planted should have sprouted up ages ago.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,"Oh, why should I try to explain it when you can see for yourself?"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,"Oh, I doubt that. [munching] Hungry? [voice over] Well, obviously things didn't go according to my original plan. My plunderseeds should have stolen the magic from the Tree of Harmony and captured Princess Celestia and Princess Luna thousands of moons ago. Alas, it seems the tree had enough magic to keep the seeds from growing up big and strong. Until now, that is."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,And rob you of a valuable lesson about being princess? What kind of friend do you think I am?
Three's A Crowd,Discord,"[sniffing] No, not a ""what"", but a ""who"", dear."
Three's A Crowd,Discord,[sneezes] [sniffs] Oh...
Three's A Crowd,Discord,"Well, of course I'm sick. The blue skin? These sneezes? Could somebody find me a fainting couch?"
Three's A Crowd,Discord,"[sneezes] [blows nose] Because this condition has left me helpless, simply helpless! Why, I can barely lift a spoon."
Three's A Crowd,Discord,"I came to find the one pony who truly understands me and could nurse me back to health. Where is that dear, sweet Fluttershy? I need attention! I need some care! I need-"
Three's A Crowd,Discord,"Oh, of course, her trip to see the Breezies. Ah, yes, I had forgotten that was today."
Three's A Crowd,Discord,"Well, she told me about it in her last letter."
Three's A Crowd,Discord,"Well, of course we do! We're friends! It's just such a shame that today of all days is when I really need her. Oh, well, I know what to do."
Three's A Crowd,Discord,"Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no! I mean, while she's gone, you ponies can take care of me! Isn't that what friends are for, taking care of each other? [laughs] Let the healing begin!"
Three's A Crowd,Discord,"I so hope you don't mind, Pinkie Pie."
Three's A Crowd,Discord,Did I hear you two talking about Princess Cadance's visit with Princess Twilight?
Three's A Crowd,Discord,"Fluttershy had mentioned that those two were getting together today. Mm-hm. How wonderful for them both. It is so rare that those two get to see one another. I don't know about you, but I sometimes wonder how close they could actually be. All those years apart before being reunited?"
Three's A Crowd,Discord,"And if they're not, this rare opportunity to focus on their friendship will certainly bring them closer. Unless..."
Three's A Crowd,Discord,Disturb them? I wouldn't dream of it. Not when I have two such dear friends of my own who have already offered to take care of me. And at such peril! This flu of mine is highly- [snorts] [sneezes] contagious.
Three's A Crowd,Discord,"Oh, dear, dear Princesses, I'm sorry to say that I'm sick. [hacks] Blue flu."
Three's A Crowd,Discord,"Indeed. How would Twilight nurse me back to health if she were sick too? You will be letting me stay at your place until I'm all better, won't you?"
Three's A Crowd,Discord,"But taking in the sick and the desperate - isn't that what Fluttershy would do? Isn't 'helping' something that friends do for friends? Unless, of course, you're really saying that you're not my friend."
Three's A Crowd,Discord,"Oh, how elated I am to hear that. Shall the three of us head back to your place? I don't want to get anypony else sick."
Three's A Crowd,Discord,Carry me?
Three's A Crowd,Discord,"Oh, poo."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Discord,"[laughs] Oh, you're talking about me, I presume?"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Discord,My ears were burning.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Discord,"Oh, just a bit of light reading before I head off on my extremely important mission. I suppose you all know that I've been tasked to capture a certain escapee."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Discord,"You're right, Spike. It is a big deal. Seems I possess a magic that gives me quite an important role in Equestria. Maybe they should make me an Alicorn princess."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Discord,Mmwah! Mmwah!
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Discord,"Oh, I never dream of such things. Ask Princess Luna."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Discord,"Yes, yes, yes, of course. It's just that I couldn't help but notice that Twilight hasn't yet opened this little chest of hers. I-I-It got me thinking, what if what's locked inside is something that could help her prove her royal worth? I only bring it up because she said that she's been feeling like her role as a princess doesn't equate to much."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Discord,"[mock sadness] Oh, my. Is eavesdropping not the way you're supposed to find out what your best pals are up to? Woe is me. Will I ever learn the intricate nuances of being a good friend?"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Discord,"[clears throat] Well in any case, I suppose now is as good a time as any for me to make my exit."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Discord,"Oopsie-doopsie, I almost left with the little journal you've all been keeping. What a fascinating read. Haven't you girls just learned so much? I've bookmarked a few of the more interesting passages. You really should take a look! [to Fluttershy, hushed] We're still on for tea later, aren't we, Fluttershy?"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Discord,"[singsong] Well, I'll bring the cucumber sandwiches...!"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Discord,"Tirek, I presume?"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Discord,As a bird.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Discord,Surprise!
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Discord,I have done nothing of the sort!
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,"[laughs] Oh, you're talking about me, I presume?"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,Haven't you girls just learned so much?
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,[shivers] That can't be right.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,Nothing. Carry on.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,"Shining Armor, why, whatever are you doing here?"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,"You meant our will, didn't you?"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,"Oh, my! I do love a good accessory. I suppose that's Rarity's influence."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,"Oh, no, I haven't touched that one yet."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,I just needed some assurance that you truly considered this a team effort. And now I have it.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,Or perhaps these things just take time.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,I did. I imagine they'll be your last decent meal for quite some time.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,Ta-da!
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,"And her little dragon, too."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,"Oh, we were. But Tirek offered me so much more than just tea parties. Surely you saw this coming."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,"If Twilight has magic to give, it will be yours. Soon there won't be a Pegasus, Earth pony or unicorn who will be able to stand up against us."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,You did.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,[weakly] But you said this was a sign of your gratitude and loyalty. A gift from someone close to you.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,[weakly] I didn't. I truly didn't.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,"[muffled] Oh, but you are, Fluttershy. You're the pony that taught me that friendship is magic. I had magic and friendship, and now I don't have either."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,"Thank you, Twilight. [to Fluttershy, hushed] I'm sorry."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,"Ohoho, but that's not all! When I went to look for them again, they were on the ceiling!"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,"Oh, I was wondering when you were going to ask me. I'd love to."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,"Who, me? It probably got lost in the mail. No biggie, as the foals say. Well, gotta go!"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,"Well, I guess we're just going to have to exclude them from our party this time. Oh, did I say that out loud? I mean, ta-ta."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,Where's Twilight?
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,"I don't suppose that, uh, these adorable little cutie pies have their own tickets to the Gross Gruesome Gala, do they?"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,"Yes, yes, yes, I believe I got that!"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,"Actually, Pinkie Pie, who are you taking to... I mean, do you... eugh, oh, you know what? I am famished. I'll take all the cakes."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,"Well, I'll need all my energy when I'm dancing at the Gala, if I decide to go that is. Oh, by the way, are you bringing anypony?"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,You know what? Cancel my order.
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,I guess every being in Equestria is funny today.
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,My vibe?
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,"Oh, well, I'm sure it is. Well, I must be off."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,Have fun at the Gala!
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,"""Oh, Tree Hugger. You're such a great friend. So much funnier than unfunny old Discord!"""
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,"""No, no, here. Take my plus-one. I insist. Before somepony else thinks he's my friend and expects to be asked instead. What's that? You're worried Discord might be upset?"" Not a problem! I can make more new friends anytime I want. It's not as if any of this actually mattered! I don't even want to go to the Gala anyway!"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,Are you perhaps looking for me?
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,My ticket to the Grand Galloping Gala! I was invited after all!
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,[grimly] Why is this so late?
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,"Good evening, everypony! What a glorious affair!"
What About Discord?,Discord,[laughing] Just snaking around!
What About Discord?,Discord,"[laughing] Catch you later, Twilight."
What About Discord?,Discord,Twilight! This makes twice I'm seeing you in one day! Aren't I lucky?
What About Discord?,Discord,You do seem to be turning a shade of... [gasps] orange!
What About Discord?,Discord,"Well, let me try and paint her a picture, dearest."
What About Discord?,Discord,"[imitating Bob Ross] You see, we were all at Sweet Apple Acres, and I ended up turning the trees into the most<U+0097> [normal] Oh, who am I kidding? I simply can't do it justice. You really had to be there."
What About Discord?,Discord,"[gulps] Oh, we were just reminiscing about the best weekend ever!"
What About Discord?,Discord,"Oh, now where was I? Ah, yes, we had just finished our soup, and then Applejack said, [imitating Applejack] ""Peanut butter hoof? Yuck, not even with jelly!"""
What About Discord?,Discord,"Oh, well, this should do!"
What About Discord?,Discord,I'm just sorry that all this bonding happened while you were holed up in your castle.
What About Discord?,Discord,"Oh, but we must! It's for the greater good! It started when we were helping Granny Smith with her garden..."
What About Discord?,Discord,Eh... All you Apples look the same. And then Rainbow Dash saw a snake!
What About Discord?,Discord,We literally trotted for our lives. Isn't that hilarious?
What About Discord?,Discord,"Oh, what a brilliant idea! Shall we begin with the lunch date that kicked off the glorious weekend you missed out on?"
What About Discord?,Discord,Ohhhhhh... it was this table here.
What About Discord?,Discord,"I'm sorry to interrupt, but I just noticed something."
What About Discord?,Discord,The tablecloth. It isn't the same color as the one the restaurant used on the day in question.
What About Discord?,Discord,"Oh, most definitely."
What About Discord?,Discord,One change to the equation could ruin the experiment. Twilight said so herself. Anything stand out as being different? Anything at all?
What About Discord?,Discord,Excellent!
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,Tea?
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,[gasps] So what you're saying is no tea? Ugh. Well. [clears throat] That's fine. I wasn't thirsty anyway.
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,You aren't kidding.
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,"Fun? With sidekicks? Oh, you must think that we're in a dimension where everything is opposite. [snap] ""Da-dee-la! I'm Opposite Discord, and I want to hang out with Spike and Big Mac! I'm sure I'd have fun!"""
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,"[snap] Let me explain it to you as simply as I can. Me? Amazing! Them? Well, I've already forgotten who we're talking about. You see?"
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,"Oh, please. Don't stoop to tedious reverse psychology. You're better than that."
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,[scoffs] Consider it considered.
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,Couldn't I just come with you instead?
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,"[gasps] Well, it's not my fault the new train route leads into an active volcano. Guess you'll have to stay."
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,"Fascinating article, yes? [nervous laugh] [hushed, to himself] Don't let them come over, please don't let them come over, please don't let them come over, please, please, please<U+0097> [normal] Oh, salutations, my friend! Wish I could stay and chat, but I don't want to."
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,"[to himself] Oh, here we go..."
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,"Oh, Twilight's friend and Applejack's monosyllabic brother, if only I weren't super busy this evening."
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,"A guys' night? You mean a rowdy evening of reckless revelry? Zoot suits, fedoras, swing dancing?"
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,"That does sound fun, actually..."
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,"Well, I suppose I could squeeze you in if I move a few very important ponies around."
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,"[gravelly accent] June, honey, be a dear. Reschedule Luna and Cay-Cay. [normal, aside] That's what I call Princess Celestia, what a hoot! [gravelly accent] In fact, clear the whole evening. Tonight is guys' night. These fellas invited me to spice things up and bring a little class to the whole affair."
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,"[normal voice] Tonight will be the best night of your lives, and not just because you get to bask in my greatness."
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,"Technically, the fun starts when I arrive, but I'll make sure it's around sunset. Adieu, fellas."
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,"So, shall we hop to it? I made a list of the rowdiest establishments in Ponyville. It's rather short."
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,Games? I love games. I'm great at games.
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Discord,"You know whenever ponies talk about powerful magic, they always leave me out. If I weren't so evolved, I might decide to take it personally. Well, isn't this quite the combination of secondary characters? Where are Twilight and the girls?"
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Discord,Shall I continue?
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Discord,[hushed] They took Fluttershy?
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Discord,[menacingly] Where?
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Discord,"Odd. I was trying to take us right to Fluttershy, but there is no Fluttershy."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,[hushed] They took Fluttershy?
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,"Oh, this is so strange. We're here and that's there, and I clearly meant for us to be there and not here."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,"Oh, well. If at first you don't succeed..."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,[blows] A what?
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,"[laughs] Oh, that's adorable. But you see, unlike you, I can do anything."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,"That's all very nice, but really a waste of time. We have me. And what else could we possibly need?"
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,"Why are you here again? I mean, it's not like you're going to stop the changelings by pulling a rabbit out of a hat. At least my magic can do something."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,"Well, that's a terrible plan. How are we even supposed to get to the hive?"
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,I haven't walked that far in a millennia!
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,"Oh, I don't know how any of you manage not being able to disappear and reappear whenever you want!"
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,"Well, it's decent chaos. I don't know if I'd call it ""total""."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,Are we sure that I'll get my magic back when we destroy this throne thingy?
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,"[sarcastic] Well, that's reassuring."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,I don't suppose you brought any throne-destroying tools along with these useless sideshow props.
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,"Yes, but when the throne is destroyed, I'll be able to rip the very fabric of reality to save our friends, while you'll still be a self-absorbed, below-average illusionist!"
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,[defeated] Okay.
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,"Oh, you keep saying that, but I haven't seen an actual changeling since we got into this hive."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,This seems like one of those moments where we need a plan.
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,"Not exactly great and powerful, but effective."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,Ugh. I really think we need a new code word!
Celestial Advice,Discord,"Yes, because you did it all by yourself."
Celestial Advice,Discord,"Yes, Starlight is student of the year, isn't she? She has so much potential. So, what are we going to do with her? And by ""we"", I definitely mean ""you"". Being her mentor and all that, her destiny falls squarely on your haunches."
Celestial Advice,Discord,"No, no. Clearly, Starlight is beyond basic friendship lessons. She just won a medal, for Equestria's sake. I thought you were joking. You are joking, right?"
Celestial Advice,Discord,"Obviously, you should have a grand master plan for her, the same way Celestia set you on the path that eventually made you a princess."
Celestial Advice,Discord,"Oh, good. I'm sure she can't wait to hear all about it."
Celestial Advice,Discord,"Oh, Starlight. Princess Twilight has something very important to tell us. Well, just you, really, but I'm nosy and I want to hear."
Celestial Advice,Discord,"Well, Twilight was just about to reveal her grand master plan for you."
Celestial Advice,Discord,Yes. I'd say we were both fairly interested.
Celestial Advice,Discord,Psst! I see what you're doing.
Celestial Advice,Discord,"You already planned the perfect moment during the party to make the grand announcement to everypony about your plan. Brava, Twilight! I can't wait to tell your plan to Fluttershy and the others!"
Celestial Advice,Discord,Whatever Twilight's planning for Starlight is going to be so exciting!
Celestial Advice,Discord,"Probably because you're not as close as you think you are. [laughs] Just kidding. She wanted it to be a big surprise. Just between us, she's getting ready to make a big announcement!"
Celestial Advice,Discord,I may have let it slip that you'd be unveiling your big plan for Starlight tonight. Silly me. But we're all very excited to hear what you've cooked up.
Celestial Advice,Discord,"You weren't coming up with a plan just now, were you? Oh, dear. This could be pretty embarrassing for you."
Celestial Advice,Discord,Anytime. I really do love being helpful.
Celestial Advice,Discord,Darn it. I was hoping you would send her to my realm. We could've been roomies. Way to not pick up what I was putting down.
Celestial Advice,Discord,"Or we could go cause a little mischief. I know a trick that'll turn Celestia's castle into cheese. Do you think it's a ""gouda"" idea? [laughs] That's just the first of many cheese jokes if we go down this path."
Discordant Harmony,Discord,Oh! You remembered to cut off the crusts for me.
Discordant Harmony,Discord,You really do make the best finger foods.
Discordant Harmony,Discord,What do you say?
Discordant Harmony,Discord,[scoffs] I really can't take them anywhere.
Discordant Harmony,Discord,Can I trouble you for another sugarcube?
Discordant Harmony,Discord,"Well, I can just pop us in some more."
Discordant Harmony,Discord,Oh. I never realized how much work you put into hosting these tea parties.
Discordant Harmony,Discord,"No, no, no, no, no! I've been taking advantage of your hospitality for far too long. It's high time I do something about it. What to do, what to do..."
Discordant Harmony,Discord,I've got it! Why don't I host the next tea party at my place?
Discordant Harmony,Discord,"Me, too! I'm so excited! I can't wait! No, really, I can't! How about we have the tea party tomorrow afternoon?"
Discordant Harmony,Discord,"Well, that's okay, because I've never hosted a tea party before."
Discordant Harmony,Discord,"Oh! I've never hosted a tea party before! So much to do! [sips tea] Thank you so much for the tea and nibblies, but I really must be going!"
Discordant Harmony,Discord,"There you go. Back to normal, just the way you like it. See you tomorrow!"
Discordant Harmony,Discord,I can't wait!
Discordant Harmony,Discord,"Okay. Since Fluttershy always goes out of her way to host the perfect tea party for me, how do I make my tea party for her even more perfect?"
Discordant Harmony,Discord,"Actually, madam, I'm talking to myself."
Discordant Harmony,Discord,It's for Fluttershy!
Discordant Harmony,Discord,You don't have to tell me that. She gave us a chance when no other pony would.
Discordant Harmony,Discord,Of course! I should get her the best of everything. Why didn't I think of that? ...Well? Are you going to answer me or not?
Discordant Harmony,Discord,Excuse me. Is this where Fluttershy usually buys her tea?
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,"Huzzah, fellow adventurers! Shall we storm the ramparts of Squizard's castle to reclaim Calico's Ring of Imperceptibility?"
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,"You did summon me for a rousing Guys' Night of Ogres & Oubliettes, did you not?"
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,You seem to be mixing up [poof!] the Lord of Chaos [poof!] with a second-rate clown magician for hire.
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,Please. Can't you see that that holiday is a commercialized ruse pushed on you by the greeting card industry?
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,Keep your eye on the pie. [<e0> la Doug Henning] It's magic time!
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,[sniffing] This smells... uh... palatable.
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,"[reading] ""Happy Hearts and Hooves Day, Sugar Belle. Meet me in my barn at sunset for a surprise."""
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,"Well, you two certainly have bought into this romance nonsense hook, line, and sinker."
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,"I'm a realist. And love, like all things warm and fuzzy, isn't real."
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,"But I do like tea! Every tea! All the teas! Chamomile, Earl Grey, green, white, yellow, mate, lemon, ginger, chai, spearmint, peppermint, hibiscus... [inhale] ...cinnamon, pumpkin spice."
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,Fine. Call it a gentleman's wager. Loser mows my lawn for eternity.
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,Tweezers!
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,How can they be happy if they aren't playing Ogres & Oubliettes?
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,"Of course. ""Love is... something-something, and Discord is great."" I don't know. Can we play O&O now?"
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,"""Spike <U+0096> Love is about spying in the bushes."""
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,You're right. She did surprise him.
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,"Oh, I hate seeing you like this, Big Mac. And over a girl, no less. I'm calling an emergency Guys' Night [poof!] right now to cheer you up."
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,Class is now in session.
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,Lesson one <U+0096> nothing can break your heart if you only love yourself. You've got to show everypony that you're too cool to be bothered with so-called love. Observe.
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,"This is how cool guys lean against things. When you see a guy leaning against a thing looking this cool, you think, ""Wow! That guy doesn't have a care in Equestria. Not a guy who leans on things that cool."""
A Matter of Principals,Discord,"[through mock tears] I hate goodbyes, don't you? I just go to pieces."
A Matter of Principals,Discord,"To fill in for Twilight, of course, as head-draconequus. I seem to recall a whole song about how this school is where you make your own rules. Now, who better at that than me?"
A Matter of Principals,Discord,Really? I thought there must be some mistake.
A Matter of Principals,Discord,"[writing] ""Item one <U+0096> Gravity is optional."""
A Matter of Principals,Discord,"""Item two <U+0096> The school's new mascot is an ambidextrous marmoset."""
A Matter of Principals,Discord,"""Item three<U+0097>"""
A Matter of Principals,Discord,Oh! Some thanks for all my help. And after I hired all those substitute teachers for you.
A Matter of Principals,Discord,Its schedule was free.
A Matter of Principals,Discord,"Mmmm, my, my, my. You do seem like you're in over your head. Won't Twilight be so disappointed with how you're ruining<U+0097>I mean, running her school?"
A Matter of Principals,Discord,Mine? I thought you were in charge here. But I'm happy to pitch in if you need me.
A Matter of Principals,Discord,Happy now?
A Matter of Principals,Discord,"Fine! From now on, I won't try to help. At! All!"
A Matter of Principals,Discord,"[California accent] Yo! Greetings, fellow creatures!"
A Matter of Principals,Discord,Is this seat taken?
A Matter of Principals,Discord,"Shhh! Really, that's so inconsiderate!"
A Matter of Principals,Discord,"Oh, I better take this. Hello?"
A Matter of Principals,Discord,"Oh, he did not! And what did you say?"
A Matter of Principals,Discord,[gasps] You did not!
A Matter of Principals,Discord,"Why, I'm a student of friendship, of course. Unless you don't think you're good enough to teach me."
A Matter of Principals,Discord,[chuckles] I'm learning so much. Aren't you?
