The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,"[laughing] Welcome to your lucky day, Rarity. You've found the one thing in Equestria that could rival my face for sheer beauty. What do you think? You like?"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,"Oh, I know much more than that, honest Applejack."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,Oh. I can see why you like these clouds so much. Very plush.
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,We'll see about that.
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,"[chuckling] Did you miss me, Celestia? I missed you. It's quite lonely being encased in stone, but you wouldn't know that, would you, because I don't turn ponies into stone."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,"The beautiful Rarity, representing the element of generosity, if I'm not mistaken?"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,It's hardly different. Your friends laugh at you all the time.
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,"That box contains your wings. You can take them and leave the game, or you can carry on aimlessly wandering this maze. Your choice."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,"What's the matter, Pinkie Pie? I thought you appreciated a good laugh?"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,"Oh, I'd forgotten how grim you can be, Celestia. It's really quite boring."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,"Oh, for goodness sake! You've been kind for far too long, my dear. Time to be cruel. Arrivederci!"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,"Listen closely, this is important. A weighty choice is yours to make:<U+00A0>the right selection or a big mistake. If a wrong choice you choose to pursue, the foundations of home will crumble without you."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,"Hey, I'm here to deliver a message."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,"[laughter] Make sense? Oh, what fun is there in making sense?"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,"Oh, you must be Rainbow Dash, famed for her loyalty, the Element of Harmony you represent."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,"Oh, poor Pinkie Pie. And here I thought laughter made you happy."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,"You'll get them back in good time. I simply took them to ensure there's no cheating. You see, this is the first rule of our game: no flying, and no magic."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,"Well, well, well, I see you've found the Elements of Harmony. How terrifying!"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,Huh. What's this? No. NO!!!
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,"I certainly am. You've clearly out-dueled me, and now it's time to meet my fate. I'm prepared to be defeated now, ladies. Fire when ready."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,Picture it. The chaos capital of the world.
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,"[laughter] Everypony has to play, or the game is over and I win."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,"I'm not playing fair? Perhaps we haven't met. I'm Discord, spirit of chaos and disharmony. Hello?"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,I never said they were in the labyrinth.
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,"Ugh, gag. Fine, go ahead. Try and use your little Elements. Friend me. Just make it quick. I'm missing some excellent chaos here."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,"[laughing] Oh, my stomach! Twilight, you've got to see what I just did."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,"Oh, you ponies are just the most fun I've had in aeons."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,"Well, wait a few minutes and you'll see it in the beautiful light of day. Or not."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,"Oh, wait, did you...? [laughter] How funny! You thought the Elements were in the labyrinth?"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,"It's priceless! [laughing] Come now, Twilight Sparkle. You've got to get into the spirit of things! After all, this is your new home."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,"Oh, this again?"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,[laughter] It's just too entertaining.
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,"[laughter] Chaos is a wonderful, wonderful thing."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,"Beautiful, isn't it? This is the new and improved Ponyville, and these are only my first of changes."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,"Keep trying, Twilight Sparkle. [mockingly] Maybe the magic of friendship can help you. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some chaos to wreak."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,"Now, look who's a liar. Anyone can plainly see that I'm not big at all."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,"Oh, yes. Thank you, Fluttershy, for your concern. If only your pony friends could be as considerate..."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,"Oh, yes, very well, I will fix it. I only ask one thing in return."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,"You like carrots, Angel? I'm playing your owner for a fool! [laughs] How d'ya like them carrots?"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,"Oh. Well, it does, very much so. You're so very kind, my dear Fluttershy. I always knew that you were the understanding one, not like those nasty friends of yours."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,Allow me.
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,"Oh, you wouldn't dare turn me back to stone and risk disappointing your precious princess."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,I ask that you never use your Element of Harmony against me. As a sign of our friendship.
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,"Who, me?"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,[groans] Alright. [quickly] Friendship is magic.
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,"May I take your... [clears throat] hats, ladies?"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,"I like it better my way, but... I guess when you're friends, you can't always have things exactly your way all the time, eh?"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,"Oh, well, that's a bit harsh, isn't it?"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,Now why in the world would I ever try to do a thing like that?
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,"Oh, well, I don't know about that. Mistakes happen. Oh, look, everypony, dancing candles!"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,"Oh, yes. Awful business, that. Mm."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,Being turned to stone doesn't keep me from hearing every word Celestia says. Although I admit it makes rolling my eyes a challenge.
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,We're friends?
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,"Oh, pfft, come skating with me, and we'll let bygones be bygones."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,"Where are you going? What's wrong, pal?"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Discord,"Oh, right, whatever."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Discord,I'll have you know that I have only one cloven hoof. Such accusations. And here I thought we were friends.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Discord,"I suppose I could, but after all the hoof pointing and besmirching of my good name, I just don't know if I'm up to it."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Discord,"Don't get me wrong. I absolutely love what you've done with the place, but I couldn't possibly take responsibility. I'm reformed, don't you remember?"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Discord,"Ladies, ladies, I'm innocent. Would I lie to you?"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Discord,"Why, [chuckles] whatever are you talking about?"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Discord,"Well, finally! Somepony willing to give me the benefit of the doubt. The rest of you could learn a lot about friendship from my dear friend Shutterfly here."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Discord,"[singing] Winter Wrap Up, Winter Wrap-ooh! [laughs] Now, Twilight, you know Princess Celestia said that you were to give me a heads up before you summon me with that little spell she gave you. In case you haven't noticed, I was in the middle of a particularly invigorating shower."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Discord,Why don't you ask your zebra friend if she knows anything?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Discord,"Well then, it seems we've reached an impasse. I'm telling the truth, but you think I'm lying. What do friends like us do in a situation like this, Princess Twilight? Congrats, by the way, on the promotion. You totally deserve it."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,"Oh, I do hope she breaks into a song this time!"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,"Bravo, ladies, bravo! How ever did you save the day this time? Blast the beastie with your magic necklaces, I presume? Where are those little trinkets of yours? You know, the ones you use to send me back to my extremely uncomfortable stone prison?"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,I have no idea. Those seeds I planted should have sprouted up ages ago.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,"[thud] Oh, poo."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,"Oh, I doubt that. [munching] Hungry? [voice over] Well, obviously things didn't go according to my original plan. My plunderseeds should have stolen the magic from the Tree of Harmony and captured Princess Celestia and Princess Luna thousands of moons ago. Alas, it seems the tree had enough magic to keep the seeds from growing up big and strong. Until now, that is."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,Ooh-hoo! I'm going to need more popcorn!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,I'm just surprised that you agreed to their plan. I never thought you'd be the kind of pony who would think she was better than everypony else.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,"Oh, why should I try to explain it when you can see for yourself?"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,I'm reformed. Don't you remember? Why don't you ask your zebra friend?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,Gone? Gone?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,"Oh, this is so much fun. How about a game of 'Pin the Tail on the Pony'?"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,[laughing] You should see yourselves right now. The expressions on your face. So intense. So sure of yourselves. [laughing] Hilarious!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,"Oh, I doubt that. [munching] Hungry? Suit yourselves. Oh! What have you got there?"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,Fine. But I don't do windows.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,You're welcome! Hmph. No luck finding your tree?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,"I for one found it delightful. Sort of a one-pony theater piece, if you will. You should really consider taking it on the road."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,And rob you of a valuable lesson about being princess? What kind of friend do you think I am?
Three's A Crowd,Discord,"Well, then lucky for you. We're here."
Three's A Crowd,Discord,"Slipped my mind. On a hill at the very edge of Equestria, there grows an exquisite magic flower. Pick the flower as it drops its petals at sunset. Then you can make a magical soothing elixir to cure the blue flu."
Three's A Crowd,Discord,I'll be grateful for your charity Until the bitter end Because I've heard that tenderness Is what you lend an ailing friend
Three's A Crowd,Discord,"Just knowing that I have a good friend like you to take care of me has made me feel better already. I'll be fine here on my own. Oh, just before you go, just a little small request."
Three's A Crowd,Discord,Inadequate hoof and claw washing?
Three's A Crowd,Discord,Carry me?
Three's A Crowd,Discord,"I so hope you don't mind, Pinkie Pie."
Three's A Crowd,Discord,"Well, [clears throat] you'll want to head north, turn left, th<U+0097> Oh... You know, it'd be much easier if I took you there myself."
Three's A Crowd,Discord,"I came to find the one pony who truly understands me and could nurse me back to health. Where is that dear, sweet Fluttershy? I need attention! I need some care! I need-"
Three's A Crowd,Discord,"[sniffing] No, not a ""what"", but a ""who"", dear."
Three's A Crowd,Discord,"Oh, how elated I am to hear that. Shall the three of us head back to your place? I don't want to get anypony else sick."
Three's A Crowd,Discord,"I'm so glad that you're back from your trip, Fluttershy. Just your presence here is making me feel so much better. I was just wondering, could I trouble you for just one more thing?"
Three's A Crowd,Discord,"[snorts] Yes, Twilight."
Three's A Crowd,Discord,"Oh, dear, dear Princesses, I'm sorry to say that I'm sick. [hacks] Blue flu."
Three's A Crowd,Discord,Did I hear you two talking about Princess Cadance's visit with Princess Twilight?
Three's A Crowd,Discord,"And if they're not, this rare opportunity to focus on their friendship will certainly bring them closer. Unless..."
Three's A Crowd,Discord,And while I get a little rest A teeny tiny small request Some codfish oil for my chest Poured from a crystal cruet
Three's A Crowd,Discord,"Well, I couldn't travel that far in my condition. By the time I got there, I'd be too weak to even attempt to retrieve the flower."
Three's A Crowd,Discord,"By seeing if you would go to the ends of Equestria for me, of course. Which you did, literally. Congratulations, Twilight, you passed my friendship test!"
Three's A Crowd,Discord,"What? I was simply going to ask for a teeny, tiny glass of water."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Discord,"Oopsie-doopsie, I almost left with the little journal you've all been keeping. What a fascinating read. Haven't you girls just learned so much? I've bookmarked a few of the more interesting passages. You really should take a look! [to Fluttershy, hushed] We're still on for tea later, aren't we, Fluttershy?"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Discord,"Yes, yes, yes, of course. It's just that I couldn't help but notice that Twilight hasn't yet opened this little chest of hers. I-I-It got me thinking, what if what's locked inside is something that could help her prove her royal worth? I only bring it up because she said that she's been feeling like her role as a princess doesn't equate to much."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Discord,"Oh, just a bit of light reading before I head off on my extremely important mission. I suppose you all know that I've been tasked to capture a certain escapee."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Discord,"Oh, I never dream of such things. Ask Princess Luna."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Discord,"[laughs] Oh, you're talking about me, I presume?"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Discord,"[singsong] Well, I'll bring the cucumber sandwiches...!"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Discord,"[clears throat] Well in any case, I suppose now is as good a time as any for me to make my exit."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Discord,Surprise!
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Discord,Mmwah! Mmwah!
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Discord,"[mock sadness] Oh, my. Is eavesdropping not the way you're supposed to find out what your best pals are up to? Woe is me. Will I ever learn the intricate nuances of being a good friend?"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Discord,I have done nothing of the sort!
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Discord,As a bird.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Discord,"Tirek, I presume?"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Discord,My ears were burning.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Discord,"You're right, Spike. It is a big deal. Seems I possess a magic that gives me quite an important role in Equestria. Maybe they should make me an Alicorn princess."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,"[muffled] Oh, but you are, Fluttershy. You're the pony that taught me that friendship is magic. I had magic and friendship, and now I don't have either."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,"Oh, my! I do love a good accessory. I suppose that's Rarity's influence."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,"Oh, we were. But Tirek offered me so much more than just tea parties. Surely you saw this coming."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,Haven't you girls just learned so much?
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,Ta-da!
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,"You meant our will, didn't you?"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,"Thank you, Twilight. [to Fluttershy, hushed] I'm sorry."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,Or perhaps these things just take time.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,"Shining Armor, why, whatever are you doing here?"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,I did. I imagine they'll be your last decent meal for quite some time.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,[shivers] That can't be right.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,You did.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,"Tirek tricked me into believing that he could offer me something more valuable than friendship. But there is nothing worth more. I see that now. He lied when he said that this medallion was given as a sign of gratitude and loyalty. But when I say that it is a sign of our true friendship, I am telling the truth."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,Nothing. Carry on.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,[weakly] I didn't. I truly didn't.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,"Oh, no, I haven't touched that one yet."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,"[chuckles] Yes, well, I suppose not."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,[weakly] But you said this was a sign of your gratitude and loyalty. A gift from someone close to you.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,"If Twilight has magic to give, it will be yours. Soon there won't be a Pegasus, Earth pony or unicorn who will be able to stand up against us."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,"And her little dragon, too."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,Have fun at the Gala!
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,"Yes, yes, yes, I believe I got that!"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,[to the Smooze] You are making me look like a fool in front of Fluttershy. I'll be back when the Gala is over.
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,"Well, friends! I think I may actually grow to like this multiple-friend thing."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,"Oh, Fluttershy. I didn't see you there."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,Exactly!
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,Do you even know what you just said?
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,"Good evening, everypony! What a glorious affair!"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,"Oh, please. I have better things to do than to watch that thing all night. [laughs nervously] What I mean to say is, that thing is a dear, dear friend, and I'll make sure that the ooze, uh, that he can't help but secrete doesn't get on anypony else."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,"Uh... [stuttering] No, I suppose not. It would just mean that I'd have different friends for different things... Oh, oh, dear, it looks like I've perhaps overreacted just a skosh."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,"I owe you an apology, Smooze. I spent the whole evening thinking about my own feelings and never thinking about yours."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,"No. I actually never said that. But funny how you remembered it that way. Anyway, good to see you. Tree Friend, is it? Your name is slipping my mind right now. How strange."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,"Oh, he's not that bad!"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,"Well, I'll need all my energy when I'm dancing at the Gala, if I decide to go that is. Oh, by the way, are you bringing anypony?"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,"Fluttershy, tell the Hugs here about the time that we went to the store and came back with two cakes instead of one, because that's how crazy we are when we're together."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,"Oh. Well, you kind of left out all the fun and frivolity there. But I'm sure you got it, Tree Hugger."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,"Who, me? It probably got lost in the mail. No biggie, as the foals say. Well, gotta go!"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,We should all go out to dinner sometime?! Have you no heart?
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,Tough crowd.
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,I guess every being in Equestria is funny today.
What About Discord?,Discord,"[laughing] Catch you later, Twilight."
What About Discord?,Discord,"Well, perhaps we should have another look at the data we've collected. [gasps] Of course! There is one last variable that we haven't accounted for."
What About Discord?,Discord,Eh... All you Apples look the same. And then Rainbow Dash saw a snake!
What About Discord?,Discord,"Orange! Like the ones at the Applejack farm! I-I mean, from this weekend!"
What About Discord?,Discord,"Certainly we can all agree that Princess Twilight learned a valuable lesson here <U+0096> that even she can have feelings of jealousy, that she should recognize said feelings rather than trying to pretend that she doesn't have them. Mm-hmm. Did I get the tiniest bit of glee out of watching her try to recreate our weekend of fun in the name of science? Oh, most definitely! But what's important here is that it was never my intent to make Twilight feel jealous. That's something that the old me would have tried to do. Orange you glad I've changed?"
What About Discord?,Discord,"Oh, now where was I? Ah, yes, we had just finished our soup, and then Applejack said, [imitating Applejack] ""Peanut butter hoof? Yuck, not even with jelly!"""
What About Discord?,Discord,Excellent!
What About Discord?,Discord,"Oh, most definitely."
What About Discord?,Discord,"I'm sorry to interrupt, but I just noticed something."
What About Discord?,Discord,"Oh, but we must! It's for the greater good! It started when we were helping Granny Smith with her garden..."
What About Discord?,Discord,"No-no-no-no-no, this is barely room temperature! Gar<e7>on! Gar<e7>on, over here!"
What About Discord?,Discord,"I'm talking to you! You! And-and you and you! W-W-What's funny about spells? I mean, really, I don't get it, I feel left out and I feel really bad about that..."
What About Discord?,Discord,"I said, Orange you glad I've changed?"
What About Discord?,Discord,"You weren't there observing us. No matter how hard we try, we can't possibly recreate our weekend of fun exactly as it happened because you'll always be watching, and you weren't there."
What About Discord?,Discord,The tablecloth. It isn't the same color as the one the restaurant used on the day in question.
What About Discord?,Discord,"Well, I didn't think that they should interrupt you. But now I see that we should have. Oh, I feel just terrible."
What About Discord?,Discord,No? Nothing?
What About Discord?,Discord,"Hi, Twilight! The gang mentioned we'd all be hanging out together today!"
What About Discord?,Discord,"A little to the left! No, my left! A little bit more... Oh, no, no, no, no, no, a little more right!"
What About Discord?,Discord,"Well, I don't know about the rest of you, but I feel we've been pretty exhaustive in our attempts to recreate every single detail of our previous encounter."
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,"Curse myself for attending this infernal evening? Ohhh, no, you mean in the game."
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,"Uh... [stammering] No, no, actually, that's not what I meant to say... I'm... sssssss..."
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,Just like in real life?
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,"[normal voice] Tonight will be the best night of your lives, and not just because you get to bask in my greatness."
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,Fear not. Your romantic delusions are safe with me.
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,Surprise! We won!
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,"Oh, you mean like trapping best friend ponies in hedge mazes and turning them against each other. Those were the days."
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,"[reverberating] You find yourself on the battlefield. A barrage of arrows rains down on you. If you roll a fifteen or higher, the shield protects you. Fourteen or lower and, well... [laughs] You get the idea."
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,[still not listening] I'm listening.
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,"Famous pony charades? Oh, this is an easy one. Who am I? Huh? Huh?"
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,Oh! You realized how amazing I am and that I make you cooler just by being around me?
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,Sit and watch? Fine. We'll play your game. [reverberating] Are you ready to enter the world of Ogres & Oubliettes?
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,Boo.
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,[clears throat] [mumbling] I'm listening.
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,Boo.
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,"I ruined your night, and you don't even think I'm cool? Ugh. [zap] [muffled] How embarrassing. I should go. [normal] I have a lot of other friends I need to see tonight."
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,"Whatever it is, it can only get better by adding me to the mix."
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,You aren't kidding.
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,[sinister] Yes?
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,"[not listening] Go on, I'm listening."
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Discord,[menacingly] Where?
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Discord,"Odd. I was trying to take us right to Fluttershy, but there is no Fluttershy."
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Discord,[hushed] They took Fluttershy?
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Discord,Shall I continue?
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Discord,"You know whenever ponies talk about powerful magic, they always leave me out. If I weren't so evolved, I might decide to take it personally. Well, isn't this quite the combination of secondary characters? Where are Twilight and the girls?"
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,"Normally, I'm the most distracting thing I can think of, but without magic..."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,"[laughs] Oh, that's adorable. But you see, unlike you, I can do anything."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,I haven't walked that far in a millennia!
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,"Yes, but when the throne is destroyed, I'll be able to rip the very fabric of reality to save our friends, while you'll still be a self-absorbed, below-average illusionist!"
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,"I mean, I'm separated from the group and just happen to come across the one pony I care most about? I can smell this setup a mile away."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,"Oh, well. If at first you don't succeed..."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,Are we sure that I'll get my magic back when we destroy this throne thingy?
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,"Well, if you think that you can do any better, be my guest!"
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,"Oh, you keep saying that, but I haven't seen an actual changeling since we got into this hive."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,But you are obviously not Fluttershy!
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,You certainly are. And I should probably help you get free. But... oh-ho-ho-ho-ho...
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,[defeated] Okay.
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,I don't suppose you brought any throne-destroying tools along with these useless sideshow props.
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,"Oh, I don't know how any of you manage not being able to disappear and reappear whenever you want!"
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,[blows] A what?
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,"Not exactly great and powerful, but effective."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,"Oh, this is so strange. We're here and that's there, and I clearly meant for us to be there and not here."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,"[nervous laugh] But, seriously, this isn't the toughest crowd I've ever been in front of. But it's definitely the easiest to bug!"
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,"That's all very nice, but really a waste of time. We have me. And what else could we possibly need?"
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,"Well, it's decent chaos. I don't know if I'd call it ""total""."
Celestial Advice,Discord,"Obviously, you should have a grand master plan for her, the same way Celestia set you on the path that eventually made you a princess."
Celestial Advice,Discord,"Oh, Starlight. Princess Twilight has something very important to tell us. Well, just you, really, but I'm nosy and I want to hear."
Celestial Advice,Discord,Yes. I'd say we were both fairly interested.
Celestial Advice,Discord,"You weren't coming up with a plan just now, were you? Oh, dear. This could be pretty embarrassing for you."
Celestial Advice,Discord,"Yes, Starlight is student of the year, isn't she? She has so much potential. So, what are we going to do with her? And by ""we"", I definitely mean ""you"". Being her mentor and all that, her destiny falls squarely on your haunches."
Celestial Advice,Discord,Psst! I see what you're doing.
Celestial Advice,Discord,"Or we could go cause a little mischief. I know a trick that'll turn Celestia's castle into cheese. Do you think it's a ""gouda"" idea? [laughs] That's just the first of many cheese jokes if we go down this path."
Celestial Advice,Discord,"Oh, good. I'm sure she can't wait to hear all about it."
Celestial Advice,Discord,"Yes, because you did it all by yourself."
Celestial Advice,Discord,I may have let it slip that you'd be unveiling your big plan for Starlight tonight. Silly me. But we're all very excited to hear what you've cooked up.
Celestial Advice,Discord,"You already planned the perfect moment during the party to make the grand announcement to everypony about your plan. Brava, Twilight! I can't wait to tell your plan to Fluttershy and the others!"
Celestial Advice,Discord,"Probably because you're not as close as you think you are. [laughs] Just kidding. She wanted it to be a big surprise. Just between us, she's getting ready to make a big announcement!"
Celestial Advice,Discord,Whatever Twilight's planning for Starlight is going to be so exciting!
Celestial Advice,Discord,Anytime. I really do love being helpful.
Celestial Advice,Discord,"No, no. Clearly, Starlight is beyond basic friendship lessons. She just won a medal, for Equestria's sake. I thought you were joking. You are joking, right?"
Celestial Advice,Discord,"Well, Twilight was just about to reveal her grand master plan for you."
Celestial Advice,Discord,Darn it. I was hoping you would send her to my realm. We could've been roomies. Way to not pick up what I was putting down.
Discordant Harmony,Discord,Can I trouble you for another sugarcube?
Discordant Harmony,Discord,How boring. Pass. Hold on! Ginseng tea! Now that sounds promising. What does it sing? I'm partial to something upbeat and jazzy.
Discordant Harmony,Discord,"Okay. Since Fluttershy always goes out of her way to host the perfect tea party for me, how do I make my tea party for her even more perfect?"
Discordant Harmony,Discord,...that lead somewhere.
Discordant Harmony,Discord,Enjoy your all-expense-paid trip around Equestria!
Discordant Harmony,Discord,"Now, let's see. I have the perfect tea and the perfect tea service. What else do I need for the perfect tea party? Oh! Decorations, of course!"
Discordant Harmony,Discord,So... all of this is just tea you simply drink?
Discordant Harmony,Discord,Oops! Butterfingers! How embarrassing.
Discordant Harmony,Discord,You don't have to tell me that. She gave us a chance when no other pony would.
Discordant Harmony,Discord,"Make Fluttershy feel comfortable, make Fluttershy feel comfortable, comfortable, comfortable... Well, I mean, that shouldn't be a problem."
Discordant Harmony,Discord,And I'm almost certain she likes stairs...
Discordant Harmony,Discord,Excuse me. Is this where Fluttershy usually buys her tea?
Discordant Harmony,Discord,"G-Greetings, friend. Please do come in."
Discordant Harmony,Discord,"Okay, let's give these conversation cards a whirl. [clears throat, reading] ""It is very nice to see you today."" ""Have you read any good books lately?"" ""Your garden looks positively lovely."""
Discordant Harmony,Discord,"Huh. Quite strange. For the first time in my life, I don't feel quite strange. In fact, I feel... completely normal. Everything is finally perfect for Fluttershy."
Discordant Harmony,Discord,Whatever do you mean?
Discordant Harmony,Discord,Hello!
Discordant Harmony,Discord,Phew!
Discordant Harmony,Discord,"No, no, no, no, no! I've been taking advantage of your hospitality for far too long. It's high time I do something about it. What to do, what to do..."
Discordant Harmony,Discord,"Me, too! I'm so excited! I can't wait! No, really, I can't! How about we have the tea party tomorrow afternoon?"
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,"[whispering] Yes, what did she do to deserve this?"
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,What?
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,Keep your eye on the pie. [<e0> la Doug Henning] It's magic time!
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,"Spike, she's an imaginary one-dimensional paper cutout skeleton."
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,"Well, she certainly doesn't seem to have appreciated it."
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,Too bad there won't be a date.
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,"So was confusion, apparently, and a fair number of assumptions."
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,"""Spike <U+0096> Love is about spying in the bushes."""
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,How can they be happy if they aren't playing Ogres & Oubliettes?
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,"Calico's Ring of Imperceptibility isn't going to reclaim itself, you know."
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,I'm helping our friend first and foremost. See for yourself.
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,"Yes, yes, I'm amazing. Anyway, since we're in the neighborhood, care for a quick game of Ogres & Oubliettes? Like I've been wanting to play all week?!"
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,Fine. Call it a gentleman's wager. Loser mows my lawn for eternity.
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,Please. Can't you see that that holiday is a commercialized ruse pushed on you by the greeting card industry?
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,"Of course. ""Love is... something-something, and Discord is great."" I don't know. Can we play O&O now?"
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,Class is now in session.
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,"Oh, I hate seeing you like this, Big Mac. And over a girl, no less. I'm calling an emergency Guys' Night [poof!] right now to cheer you up."
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,"You did summon me for a rousing Guys' Night of Ogres & Oubliettes, did you not?"
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,[sniffing] This smells... uh... palatable.
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,You're right. She did surprise him.
A Matter of Principals,Discord,"I accept! I mean, I-I-I suppose I can find some time in my busy schedule to help you out. But I will need my own office, expense account, parking space..."
A Matter of Principals,Discord,I wouldn't be so sure.
A Matter of Principals,Discord,Oh! Some thanks for all my help. And after I hired all those substitute teachers for you.
A Matter of Principals,Discord,"Oh, poo! I just ordered business cards!"
A Matter of Principals,Discord,Happy now?
A Matter of Principals,Discord,Its schedule was free.
A Matter of Principals,Discord,"""Item two <U+0096> The school's new mascot is an ambidextrous marmoset."""
A Matter of Principals,Discord,"To fill in for Twilight, of course, as head-draconequus. I seem to recall a whole song about how this school is where you make your own rules. Now, who better at that than me?"
A Matter of Principals,Discord,Really? I thought there must be some mistake.
A Matter of Principals,Discord,[chuckles] I'm learning so much. Aren't you?
A Matter of Principals,Discord,"Oh, I better take this. Hello?"
A Matter of Principals,Discord,[snaps fingers] Everything is re-hidden.
A Matter of Principals,Discord,[gasps] You did not!
A Matter of Principals,Discord,"Take a lap, team!"
A Matter of Principals,Discord,"[through mock tears] I hate goodbyes, don't you? I just go to pieces."
A Matter of Principals,Discord,"Oh, back so soon?"
A Matter of Principals,Discord,"Oh, he did not! And what did you say?"
A Matter of Principals,Discord,"""Item three<U+0097>"""
A Matter of Principals,Discord,"Fine! From now on, I won't try to help. At! All!"
A Matter of Principals,Discord,"[California accent] Yo! Greetings, fellow creatures!"
