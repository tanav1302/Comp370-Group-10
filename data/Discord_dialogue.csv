The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,"Oh, poor Pinkie Pie. And here I thought laughter made you happy."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,"[laughing] Welcome to your lucky day, Rarity. You've found the one thing in Equestria that could rival my face for sheer beauty. What do you think? You like?"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,It's hardly different. Your friends laugh at you all the time.
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,"You'll get them back in good time. I simply took them to ensure there's no cheating. You see, this is the first rule of our game: no flying, and no magic."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,We'll see about that.
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,"[chuckling] Did you miss me, Celestia? I missed you. It's quite lonely being encased in stone, but you wouldn't know that, would you, because I don't turn ponies into stone."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,"What's the matter, Pinkie Pie? I thought you appreciated a good laugh?"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,"Listen closely, this is important. A weighty choice is yours to make:<U+00A0>the right selection or a big mistake. If a wrong choice you choose to pursue, the foundations of home will crumble without you."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,"Oh, I know much more than that, honest Applejack."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,"The beautiful Rarity, representing the element of generosity, if I'm not mistaken?"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,"Oh, for goodness sake! You've been kind for far too long, my dear. Time to be cruel. Arrivederci!"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,"Hey, I'm here to deliver a message."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,"That box contains your wings. You can take them and leave the game, or you can carry on aimlessly wandering this maze. Your choice."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,"[laughter] Make sense? Oh, what fun is there in making sense?"
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,"Oh, you must be Rainbow Dash, famed for her loyalty, the Element of Harmony you represent."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,"Oh, I'd forgotten how grim you can be, Celestia. It's really quite boring."
The Return of Harmony Part 1,Discord,Oh. I can see why you like these clouds so much. Very plush.
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,"It's priceless! [laughing] Come now, Twilight Sparkle. You've got to get into the spirit of things! After all, this is your new home."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,"[laughter] Chaos is a wonderful, wonderful thing."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,"Beautiful, isn't it? This is the new and improved Ponyville, and these are only my first of changes."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,Huh. What's this? No. NO!!!
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,"Well, wait a few minutes and you'll see it in the beautiful light of day. Or not."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,"Oh, you ponies are just the most fun I've had in aeons."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,"[laughter] Everypony has to play, or the game is over and I win."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,[laughter] It's just too entertaining.
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,"Keep trying, Twilight Sparkle. [mockingly] Maybe the magic of friendship can help you. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some chaos to wreak."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,"I'm not playing fair? Perhaps we haven't met. I'm Discord, spirit of chaos and disharmony. Hello?"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,"I certainly am. You've clearly out-dueled me, and now it's time to meet my fate. I'm prepared to be defeated now, ladies. Fire when ready."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,"Oh, wait, did you...? [laughter] How funny! You thought the Elements were in the labyrinth?"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,"Well, well, well, I see you've found the Elements of Harmony. How terrifying!"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,Picture it. The chaos capital of the world.
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,I never said they were in the labyrinth.
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,"Oh, this again?"
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,"Ugh, gag. Fine, go ahead. Try and use your little Elements. Friend me. Just make it quick. I'm missing some excellent chaos here."
The Return of Harmony Part 2,Discord,"[laughing] Oh, my stomach! Twilight, you've got to see what I just did."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,Wh-what?! Look at me! I'm practically reformed already.
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,Allow me.
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,"May I take your... [clears throat] hats, ladies?"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,"Where are you going? What's wrong, pal?"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,"Oh. Well, it does, very much so. You're so very kind, my dear Fluttershy. I always knew that you were the understanding one, not like those nasty friends of yours."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,"Yes, Princess, I'm ready to use my magic for good instead of evil. [under his breath] Most of the time."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,"Fluttershy, oh, there you are. A sight for sore eyes."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,Oh... [sniggers] He's adorable the way he is.
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,"Now, look who's a liar. Anyone can plainly see that I'm not big at all."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,[groans] Alright. [quickly] Friendship is magic.
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,"Who cares? I can do whatever I want, whenever I want. I'm Discord, the master of chaos! You think you can boss Discord around? You think I'm just going to turn all this back because you say so? Because if I don't, I'll lose the one friend I ever had? [pause] Oh. Oh. Well played, Fluttershy. Well played."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,"Hey there, Fluttershy, you want a turn? The water's great!"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,I ask that you never use your Element of Harmony against me. As a sign of our friendship.
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,"Oh, our pony guests! [upper class voice] We're so delighted that you've come. Please, do come in."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,"[eating] Are you sure this isn't overdoing it? You said to make myself at home while you were gone, but I wouldn't want to overstep my bounds."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,"Oh, yes, very well, I will fix it. I only ask one thing in return."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,"Oh, you wouldn't dare turn me back to stone and risk disappointing your precious princess."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,"[blows raspberry] You know what else is adorable? You ponies truly believe that you can reform me, and that you're putting your faith in this one here to make it happen. Makes me wanna pinch your little horsey cheeks..."
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,"I like it better my way, but... I guess when you're friends, you can't always have things exactly your way all the time, eh?"
Keep Calm and Flutter On,Discord,Being turned to stone doesn't keep me from hearing every word Celestia says. Although I admit it makes rolling my eyes a challenge.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Discord,I'll have you know that I have only one cloven hoof. Such accusations. And here I thought we were friends.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Discord,"Well then, it seems we've reached an impasse. I'm telling the truth, but you think I'm lying. What do friends like us do in a situation like this, Princess Twilight? Congrats, by the way, on the promotion. You totally deserve it."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Discord,Why don't you ask your zebra friend if she knows anything?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Discord,"Ladies, ladies, I'm innocent. Would I lie to you?"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Discord,"Oh, right, whatever."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Discord,"Well, finally! Somepony willing to give me the benefit of the doubt. The rest of you could learn a lot about friendship from my dear friend Shutterfly here."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Discord,"Don't get me wrong. I absolutely love what you've done with the place, but I couldn't possibly take responsibility. I'm reformed, don't you remember?"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Discord,"[singing] Winter Wrap Up, Winter Wrap-ooh! [laughs] Now, Twilight, you know Princess Celestia said that you were to give me a heads up before you summon me with that little spell she gave you. In case you haven't noticed, I was in the middle of a particularly invigorating shower."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Discord,"Why, [chuckles] whatever are you talking about?"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 1,Discord,"I suppose I could, but after all the hoof pointing and besmirching of my good name, I just don't know if I'm up to it."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,Ooh-hoo! I'm going to need more popcorn!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,And rob you of a valuable lesson about being princess? What kind of friend do you think I am?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,"Oh, why should I try to explain it when you can see for yourself?"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,I'm just surprised that you agreed to their plan. I never thought you'd be the kind of pony who would think she was better than everypony else.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,You're welcome! Hmph. No luck finding your tree?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,I'm reformed. Don't you remember? Why don't you ask your zebra friend?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,"Oh, I doubt that. [munching] Hungry? [voice over] Well, obviously things didn't go according to my original plan. My plunderseeds should have stolen the magic from the Tree of Harmony and captured Princess Celestia and Princess Luna thousands of moons ago. Alas, it seems the tree had enough magic to keep the seeds from growing up big and strong. Until now, that is."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,"Oh, I do hope she breaks into a song this time!"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,Fine. But I don't do windows.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,Gone? Gone?
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,"Bravo, ladies, bravo! How ever did you save the day this time? Blast the beastie with your magic necklaces, I presume? Where are those little trinkets of yours? You know, the ones you use to send me back to my extremely uncomfortable stone prison?"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,"I for one found it delightful. Sort of a one-pony theater piece, if you will. You should really consider taking it on the road."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,I have no idea. Those seeds I planted should have sprouted up ages ago.
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,"Oh, this is so much fun. How about a game of 'Pin the Tail on the Pony'?"
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,"[thud] Oh, poo."
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,[laughing] You should see yourselves right now. The expressions on your face. So intense. So sure of yourselves. [laughing] Hilarious!
Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2,Discord,"Oh, I doubt that. [munching] Hungry? Suit yourselves. Oh! What have you got there?"
Three's A Crowd,Discord,And while I get a little rest A teeny tiny small request Some codfish oil for my chest Poured from a crystal cruet
Three's A Crowd,Discord,Carry me?
Three's A Crowd,Discord,"Well, I was in my thinking tree <U+0096> that's where I do most of my really deep thinking <U+0096> I was there, and I said to myself, I said, ""Discord, your friend Twilight says that she's your pal, but she never writes and she never pops in for a visit."""
Three's A Crowd,Discord,"I so hope you don't mind, Pinkie Pie."
Three's A Crowd,Discord,"By seeing if you would go to the ends of Equestria for me, of course. Which you did, literally. Congratulations, Twilight, you passed my friendship test!"
Three's A Crowd,Discord,"Oh, how elated I am to hear that. Shall the three of us head back to your place? I don't want to get anypony else sick."
Three's A Crowd,Discord,"Well, I couldn't travel that far in my condition. By the time I got there, I'd be too weak to even attempt to retrieve the flower."
Three's A Crowd,Discord,"I came to find the one pony who truly understands me and could nurse me back to health. Where is that dear, sweet Fluttershy? I need attention! I need some care! I need-"
Three's A Crowd,Discord,What in the world?!
Three's A Crowd,Discord,"[sniffing] No, not a ""what"", but a ""who"", dear."
Three's A Crowd,Discord,But how was I supposed to know for sure that I'm truly still friends with one of the most important ponies around?
Three's A Crowd,Discord,"Well, she told me about it in her last letter."
Three's A Crowd,Discord,It's just at the top of that hill.
Three's A Crowd,Discord,"Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no! I mean, while she's gone, you ponies can take care of me! Isn't that what friends are for, taking care of each other? [laughs] Let the healing begin!"
Three's A Crowd,Discord,"Oh, of course, her trip to see the Breezies. Ah, yes, I had forgotten that was today."
Three's A Crowd,Discord,I was! But I had a very good reason.
Three's A Crowd,Discord,"""Now that she's a princess, maybe she's decided that she's too good for you."""
Three's A Crowd,Discord,"Just knowing that I have a good friend like you to take care of me has made me feel better already. I'll be fine here on my own. Oh, just before you go, just a little small request."
Three's A Crowd,Discord,A little glass of water please A fresh pressed hanky if I sneeze Some tea with honey from the bees Whenever you can brew it
Three's A Crowd,Discord,"[snorts] Yes, Twilight."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Discord,"Yes, yes, yes, of course. It's just that I couldn't help but notice that Twilight hasn't yet opened this little chest of hers. I-I-It got me thinking, what if what's locked inside is something that could help her prove her royal worth? I only bring it up because she said that she's been feeling like her role as a princess doesn't equate to much."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Discord,Mmwah! Mmwah!
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Discord,I have done nothing of the sort!
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Discord,Surprise!
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Discord,"[mock sadness] Oh, my. Is eavesdropping not the way you're supposed to find out what your best pals are up to? Woe is me. Will I ever learn the intricate nuances of being a good friend?"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Discord,"Oh, just a bit of light reading before I head off on my extremely important mission. I suppose you all know that I've been tasked to capture a certain escapee."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Discord,"[clears throat] Well in any case, I suppose now is as good a time as any for me to make my exit."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Discord,"[singsong] Well, I'll bring the cucumber sandwiches...!"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Discord,As a bird.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Discord,My ears were burning.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Discord,"You're right, Spike. It is a big deal. Seems I possess a magic that gives me quite an important role in Equestria. Maybe they should make me an Alicorn princess."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Discord,"[laughs] Oh, you're talking about me, I presume?"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Discord,"Oopsie-doopsie, I almost left with the little journal you've all been keeping. What a fascinating read. Haven't you girls just learned so much? I've bookmarked a few of the more interesting passages. You really should take a look! [to Fluttershy, hushed] We're still on for tea later, aren't we, Fluttershy?"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Discord,"Tirek, I presume?"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1,Discord,"Oh, I never dream of such things. Ask Princess Luna."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,"[laughs] Oh, you're talking about me, I presume?"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,"If Twilight has magic to give, it will be yours. Soon there won't be a Pegasus, Earth pony or unicorn who will be able to stand up against us."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,"You meant our will, didn't you?"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,You did.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,I did. I imagine they'll be your last decent meal for quite some time.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,"Thank you, Twilight. [to Fluttershy, hushed] I'm sorry."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,"Shining Armor, why, whatever are you doing here?"
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,"[muffled] Oh, but you are, Fluttershy. You're the pony that taught me that friendship is magic. I had magic and friendship, and now I don't have either."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,Ta-da!
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,I just needed some assurance that you truly considered this a team effort. And now I have it.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,[weakly] But you said this was a sign of your gratitude and loyalty. A gift from someone close to you.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,"[chuckles] Yes, well, I suppose not."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,Or perhaps these things just take time.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,Nothing. Carry on.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,Haven't you girls just learned so much?
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,"Oh, we were. But Tirek offered me so much more than just tea parties. Surely you saw this coming."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,"And her little dragon, too."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,[weakly] I didn't. I truly didn't.
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,"Oh, no, I haven't touched that one yet."
Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2,Discord,"Tirek tricked me into believing that he could offer me something more valuable than friendship. But there is nothing worth more. I see that now. He lied when he said that this medallion was given as a sign of gratitude and loyalty. But when I say that it is a sign of our true friendship, I am telling the truth."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,"Well, friends! I think I may actually grow to like this multiple-friend thing."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,"I've only got these tiny mismatched wings, and even I can fly better than Twilight Sparkle! Am I right? Pchoo!"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,"Oh, well, I'm sure it is. Well, I must be off."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,We should all go out to dinner sometime?! Have you no heart?
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,"Oh, please. I have better things to do than to watch that thing all night. [laughs nervously] What I mean to say is, that thing is a dear, dear friend, and I'll make sure that the ooze, uh, that he can't help but secrete doesn't get on anypony else."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,"Treezie? Really? Sort of a juvenile nickname, don't you think?"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,"[laughs nervously] Uh, well, perhaps you're into more observational humor."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,"""No, no, here. Take my plus-one. I insist. Before somepony else thinks he's my friend and expects to be asked instead. What's that? You're worried Discord might be upset?"" Not a problem! I can make more new friends anytime I want. It's not as if any of this actually mattered! I don't even want to go to the Gala anyway!"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,Do you even know what you just said?
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,Relax. I'm not going to hurt you. I'm simply going to send you to another dimension. I can't have you interfering in my relationship with Fluttershy anymore!
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,You've gotta be kidding. You don't remember me?
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,I guess every being in Equestria is funny today.
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,"Well, I'll need all my energy when I'm dancing at the Gala, if I decide to go that is. Oh, by the way, are you bringing anypony?"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,"I don't suppose that, uh, these adorable little cutie pies have their own tickets to the Gross Gruesome Gala, do they?"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,"Yes, because that's what you did!"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,"I'm doing her a favor, Fluttershy! It's a lovely dimension! White sand beaches, attentive wait staff... I mean, okay, the humidity isn't great, but where isn't that the case these days?"
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,"""Oh, Tree Hugger. You're such a great friend. So much funnier than unfunny old Discord!"""
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,[muffled and out of focus] You might be a Ponyville pony when an ordinary night on the town ends in a lesson about friendship! [in focus] Knock knock!
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,"He does have a yen for shiny things, the rascal."
Make New Friends but Keep Discord,Discord,"Well, I'm glad you got that, because that's what is true. We are."
What About Discord?,Discord,No? Nothing?
What About Discord?,Discord,Twilight! This makes twice I'm seeing you in one day! Aren't I lucky?
What About Discord?,Discord,"[imitating Bob Ross] You see, we were all at Sweet Apple Acres, and I ended up turning the trees into the most<U+0097> [normal] Oh, who am I kidding? I simply can't do it justice. You really had to be there."
What About Discord?,Discord,"Well, I don't know about the rest of you, but I feel we've been pretty exhaustive in our attempts to recreate every single detail of our previous encounter."
What About Discord?,Discord,Of course none of this would've happened if I hadn't encouraged everypony not to invite you this weekend.
What About Discord?,Discord,I'm just sorry that all this bonding happened while you were holed up in your castle.
What About Discord?,Discord,"Oh, now where was I? Ah, yes, we had just finished our soup, and then Applejack said, [imitating Applejack] ""Peanut butter hoof? Yuck, not even with jelly!"""
What About Discord?,Discord,Of course not. That whole jealousy thing was just a happy accident.
What About Discord?,Discord,W-W-What's so funny?
What About Discord?,Discord,"[laughing] Catch you later, Twilight."
What About Discord?,Discord,"Orange! Like the ones at the Applejack farm! I-I mean, from this weekend!"
What About Discord?,Discord,"Oh, what a brilliant idea! Shall we begin with the lunch date that kicked off the glorious weekend you missed out on?"
What About Discord?,Discord,The tablecloth. It isn't the same color as the one the restaurant used on the day in question.
What About Discord?,Discord,"Certainly we can all agree that Princess Twilight learned a valuable lesson here <U+0096> that even she can have feelings of jealousy, that she should recognize said feelings rather than trying to pretend that she doesn't have them. Mm-hmm. Did I get the tiniest bit of glee out of watching her try to recreate our weekend of fun in the name of science? Oh, most definitely! But what's important here is that it was never my intent to make Twilight feel jealous. That's something that the old me would have tried to do. Orange you glad I've changed?"
What About Discord?,Discord,"I said, Orange you glad I've changed?"
What About Discord?,Discord,"Oh, most definitely."
What About Discord?,Discord,"A little to the left! No, my left! A little bit more... Oh, no, no, no, no, no, a little more right!"
What About Discord?,Discord,"You weren't there observing us. No matter how hard we try, we can't possibly recreate our weekend of fun exactly as it happened because you'll always be watching, and you weren't there."
What About Discord?,Discord,Better?
What About Discord?,Discord,Ohhhhhh... it was this table here.
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,I stick my head through the bars and demand for the immediate release of the Lord of Chaos.
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,[reverberating] [chuckles] You're welcome.
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,"Oh, well."
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,"[normal voice] Tonight will be the best night of your lives, and not just because you get to bask in my greatness."
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,[scoffs] Consider it considered.
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,I don't think so. Let's have a drink. Chocolate milkshakes?
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,"[to himself] Oh, here we go..."
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,"Oh, you mean like trapping best friend ponies in hedge mazes and turning them against each other. Those were the days."
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,"If I'm the worst, then why did you invite me?"
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,Nice one!
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,Sit and watch? Fine. We'll play your game. [reverberating] Are you ready to enter the world of Ogres & Oubliettes?
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,You aren't kidding.
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,"[reverberating] You find yourself on the battlefield. A barrage of arrows rains down on you. If you roll a fifteen or higher, the shield protects you. Fourteen or lower and, well... [laughs] You get the idea."
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,"Uh... [stammering] No, no, actually, that's not what I meant to say... I'm... sssssss..."
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,"[snap] Let me explain it to you as simply as I can. Me? Amazing! Them? Well, I've already forgotten who we're talking about. You see?"
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,"Sir McBiggun, I'd cover the entrance if I were you."
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,[gasps] So what you're saying is no tea? Ugh. Well. [clears throat] That's fine. I wasn't thirsty anyway.
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,"Technically, the fun starts when I arrive, but I'll make sure it's around sunset. Adieu, fellas."
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,"[gasps] Well, it's not my fault the new train route leads into an active volcano. Guess you'll have to stay."
Dungeons & Discords,Discord,[accented] Garbunkle! Follow my lead!
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Discord,"You know whenever ponies talk about powerful magic, they always leave me out. If I weren't so evolved, I might decide to take it personally. Well, isn't this quite the combination of secondary characters? Where are Twilight and the girls?"
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Discord,[menacingly] Where?
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Discord,[hushed] They took Fluttershy?
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Discord,"Odd. I was trying to take us right to Fluttershy, but there is no Fluttershy."
To Where and Back Again - Part 1,Discord,Shall I continue?
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,This seems like one of those moments where we need a plan.
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,"Oh, you keep saying that, but I haven't seen an actual changeling since we got into this hive."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,"Well, it's decent chaos. I don't know if I'd call it ""total""."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,But you are obviously not Fluttershy!
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,I haven't walked that far in a millennia!
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,"[sarcastic] Well, that's reassuring."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,[hushed] They took Fluttershy?
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,"Well, if you think that you can do any better, be my guest!"
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,"Actually, I was going to say a couple of those illusions were slightly above average. If you ever need a little chaos in your act, let me know."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,"Well, that's a terrible plan. How are we even supposed to get to the hive?"
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,"Not exactly great and powerful, but effective."
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,I don't suppose you brought any throne-destroying tools along with these useless sideshow props.
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,It is certainly a pleasure to have such dedicated fans. I'll have to come back with some new material after I rescue Fluttershy.
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,Fluttershy!
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,Are we sure that I'll get my magic back when we destroy this throne thingy?
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,"Oh, I don't know how any of you manage not being able to disappear and reappear whenever you want!"
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,Fluttershy?
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,You certainly are. And I should probably help you get free. But... oh-ho-ho-ho-ho...
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,So I'm able to rip the very fabric of reality again.
To Where and Back Again - Part 2,Discord,"[taps microphone] Hello, changelings and changelettes! Believe me, I was just as surprised as you are that I'm here! When I heard that I'd be playing for a bunch of changelings, I was beside myself! Then I realized, it was just one of you."
Celestial Advice,Discord,"You already planned the perfect moment during the party to make the grand announcement to everypony about your plan. Brava, Twilight! I can't wait to tell your plan to Fluttershy and the others!"
Celestial Advice,Discord,I may have let it slip that you'd be unveiling your big plan for Starlight tonight. Silly me. But we're all very excited to hear what you've cooked up.
Celestial Advice,Discord,"Yes, because you did it all by yourself."
Celestial Advice,Discord,"Or we could go cause a little mischief. I know a trick that'll turn Celestia's castle into cheese. Do you think it's a ""gouda"" idea? [laughs] That's just the first of many cheese jokes if we go down this path."
Celestial Advice,Discord,"No, no. Clearly, Starlight is beyond basic friendship lessons. She just won a medal, for Equestria's sake. I thought you were joking. You are joking, right?"
Celestial Advice,Discord,Psst! I see what you're doing.
Celestial Advice,Discord,"Obviously, you should have a grand master plan for her, the same way Celestia set you on the path that eventually made you a princess."
Celestial Advice,Discord,Whatever Twilight's planning for Starlight is going to be so exciting!
Celestial Advice,Discord,"You weren't coming up with a plan just now, were you? Oh, dear. This could be pretty embarrassing for you."
Celestial Advice,Discord,Yes. I'd say we were both fairly interested.
Celestial Advice,Discord,"Oh, Starlight. Princess Twilight has something very important to tell us. Well, just you, really, but I'm nosy and I want to hear."
Celestial Advice,Discord,"Well, Twilight was just about to reveal her grand master plan for you."
Celestial Advice,Discord,Anytime. I really do love being helpful.
Celestial Advice,Discord,"Yes, Starlight is student of the year, isn't she? She has so much potential. So, what are we going to do with her? And by ""we"", I definitely mean ""you"". Being her mentor and all that, her destiny falls squarely on your haunches."
Celestial Advice,Discord,"Probably because you're not as close as you think you are. [laughs] Just kidding. She wanted it to be a big surprise. Just between us, she's getting ready to make a big announcement!"
Celestial Advice,Discord,Darn it. I was hoping you would send her to my realm. We could've been roomies. Way to not pick up what I was putting down.
Celestial Advice,Discord,"Oh, good. I'm sure she can't wait to hear all about it."
Discordant Harmony,Discord,I have... no idea.
Discordant Harmony,Discord,You really do make the best finger foods.
Discordant Harmony,Discord,"Huh. Quite strange. For the first time in my life, I don't feel quite strange. In fact, I feel... completely normal. Everything is finally perfect for Fluttershy."
Discordant Harmony,Discord,Enjoy your all-expense-paid trip around Equestria!
Discordant Harmony,Discord,And I'm almost certain she likes stairs...
Discordant Harmony,Discord,"Well, I can just pop us in some more."
Discordant Harmony,Discord,"Me, too! I'm so excited! I can't wait! No, really, I can't! How about we have the tea party tomorrow afternoon?"
Discordant Harmony,Discord,"Well done, everybody, but there's still more work to do."
Discordant Harmony,Discord,[laughs] Singing ginseng! I'll take it!
Discordant Harmony,Discord,"Well, of course we're friends! She gets me, and you obviously do not! [imitating ""Jasmine Leaf""] ""Are you sure you're friends with Fluttershy?"" [scoffs] The very nerve!"
Discordant Harmony,Discord,"And that's why you're the party expert. Thank you, Pinkie Pie. I feel so much better now."
Discordant Harmony,Discord,What particularly nice weather we're having.
Discordant Harmony,Discord,That bad?
Discordant Harmony,Discord,"Okay. Since Fluttershy always goes out of her way to host the perfect tea party for me, how do I make my tea party for her even more perfect?"
Discordant Harmony,Discord,"Well, whatever do you mean? This is just me being me."
Discordant Harmony,Discord,I've got it! Why don't I host the next tea party at my place?
Discordant Harmony,Discord,You do?
Discordant Harmony,Discord,Do something chaotic? I'll try...
Discordant Harmony,Discord,"[sips tea] It did rain the other day, however."
Discordant Harmony,Discord,I'm sorry. Do you validate?
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,Who do you think broke Sugar Belle's wagon wheel?
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,"Oh, I hate seeing you like this, Big Mac. And over a girl, no less. I'm calling an emergency Guys' Night [poof!] right now to cheer you up."
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,"This is how cool guys lean against things. When you see a guy leaning against a thing looking this cool, you think, ""Wow! That guy doesn't have a care in Equestria. Not a guy who leans on things that cool."""
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,Class is now in session.
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,"Calico's Ring of Imperceptibility isn't going to reclaim itself, you know."
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,Fine. Call it a gentleman's wager. Loser mows my lawn for eternity.
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,"Well, you two certainly have bought into this romance nonsense hook, line, and sinker."
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,"Spike, she's an imaginary one-dimensional paper cutout skeleton."
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,"[whispering] Yes, what did she do to deserve this?"
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,What?
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,Lesson one <U+0096> nothing can break your heart if you only love yourself. You've got to show everypony that you're too cool to be bothered with so-called love. Observe.
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,"Well, she certainly doesn't seem to have appreciated it."
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,"But I do like tea! Every tea! All the teas! Chamomile, Earl Grey, green, white, yellow, mate, lemon, ginger, chai, spearmint, peppermint, hibiscus... [inhale] ...cinnamon, pumpkin spice."
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,[sniffing] This smells... uh... palatable.
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,"Huzzah, fellow adventurers! Shall we storm the ramparts of Squizard's castle to reclaim Calico's Ring of Imperceptibility?"
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,"No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no. No, he's not. Let me see that."
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,"Well, not yet, technically. In fact, she can't break your heart if you break hers first."
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,How can they be happy if they aren't playing Ogres & Oubliettes?
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,Keep your eye on the pie. [<e0> la Doug Henning] It's magic time!
The Break Up Break Down,Discord,You're right. She did surprise him.
A Matter of Principals,Discord,"My problem? How is the fact that Twilight decided to put an incompetent, power-hungry unicorn in charge of her school my problem?!"
A Matter of Principals,Discord,"Mmmm, my, my, my. You do seem like you're in over your head. Won't Twilight be so disappointed with how you're ruining<U+0097>I mean, running her school?"
A Matter of Principals,Discord,"Oh, he did not! And what did you say?"
A Matter of Principals,Discord,[gasps] You did not!
A Matter of Principals,Discord,Is this seat taken?
A Matter of Principals,Discord,"[through mock tears] I hate goodbyes, don't you? I just go to pieces."
A Matter of Principals,Discord,"Oh, back so soon?"
A Matter of Principals,Discord,Mine? I thought you were in charge here. But I'm happy to pitch in if you need me.
A Matter of Principals,Discord,"To fill in for Twilight, of course, as head-draconequus. I seem to recall a whole song about how this school is where you make your own rules. Now, who better at that than me?"
A Matter of Principals,Discord,"Shhh! Really, that's so inconsiderate!"
A Matter of Principals,Discord,"[California accent] Yo! Greetings, fellow creatures!"
A Matter of Principals,Discord,[chuckles] I'm learning so much. Aren't you?
A Matter of Principals,Discord,"Oh, poo! I just ordered business cards!"
A Matter of Principals,Discord,I wouldn't be so sure.
A Matter of Principals,Discord,"Why, I'm a student of friendship, of course. Unless you don't think you're good enough to teach me."
A Matter of Principals,Discord,"[writing] ""Item one <U+0096> Gravity is optional."""
A Matter of Principals,Discord,Happy now?
A Matter of Principals,Discord,"[chuckles] Well, with a few surprises."
A Matter of Principals,Discord,Uh... [stuttering] I don't know what you're getting at.
A Matter of Principals,Discord,"""Item three<U+0097>"""
